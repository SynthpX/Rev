Review,Label
"You know how romance anime tend to either be way too fast paced or incredibly slow paced? This is something that annoys me very often, but not at all in this case. Soredemo sekai Wa utsukushii is a beautiful, fun and interesting anime that got me hooked from episode one, and by the last episode I longed for more.
Oh, and don't worry, it's not pedophilia. Probably. Just ignore that.
Story 9/10:
The story in this anime may sound boring because of the whole ""adult princess forced to marry young king"" theme that it starts of with, but don't let that fool you! This anime
has really well paced romance and character development, and has that little something about it that makes you want to see what happens next. Everything keeps a steady pace so it doesn't have the last-minute kiss kind of development, but a romance that we can clearly see and follow as it grows stronger and more beautiful than a lot of other romance anime that I've watched.
You would also think that Nike and Livi would look like sister and brother, what with the age difference, but I never once thought they looked like that. From the start they looked like a boy and a girl in a relationship that would start out rough, but was soon to bloom.
Art 7/10:
I can't really say that the art stood out a lot. It looked ordinary, but beautiful, something which fit this anime really well. Sometimes there was a really beautiful scene, then it would go back to the more ordinary style. The character design was very fitting to the different personalities and most of them looked really good. They didn't have any unnecessary, super moe or fan service-ish features to them, with the exception of a few side characters.
Sound 10/10:
Ah, the music. The instrumental soundtrack mixed very well with the different scenes. It created emotion, smiles, tears and laughter. It wasn't really something I was aware of during the anime, but after listening to the tracks separately, it's really amazing. it's intense, beautiful and a joy to the ears. If you're looking for some serious eargasm, look no further.
The opening and ending theme is really catchy and beautiful too. The opening has that kind of rhythm to it that makes it hard to sit still and not get chills from the awesome drums and voice.
Also, Nikes rain-summoning song is just angelic. With a hint of engrish (I misspelled that on purpose) and a beautiful instrumental and vocal harmony, it makes me think of the relaxing sound of falling rain.
Character 9/10:
There are very few cardboard clip-out characters in this anime. By that I mean that there wasn't a generic main character, a cute and happy character or any of the typical -dere characters, with the exception of one side character. This is something I'm really happy about. These kind of characters get boring quickly and lowers the enjoyment.
To start off let's talk about Princess Nike. She is a very strong-willed and brave girl who can never sit still and hates wearing pretty dresses and high heels. Pretty much the exact opposite of a typical princess, a real tomboy. But even though she may seem a little boyish, she is very gentle, likable, has a strong sense of justice and loyalty, and cares for the people around her. Oh, and did I mention that her singing can call forth rain? Now if that isn't awesome, nothing is.
The only thing I found strange about Nike is that in the first few episodes Nike is dead set on the fact that summoning rain is a sacred ritual and can't be done just on someones whim, yet she calls the rain almost every other episode. A little strange, but doesn't ruin anything.
Then theres the Sun King Livi. This young king may seem angry, strict and unapproachable at first, but when you get to know him he's a sweet and gentle boy who really cares for his country. He works hard and tries his best to be a good king, despite his age. When he starts to care about someone, he doesn't do it half-heartedly, but at the same time you don't want to get on his bad side.
All the side characters gets their fare share of screen time, but you won't remember most of their names by the end. There are a few bigger side characters that helps the plot along, but the character awesomeness award goes to Nike and Livi, by far.
Enjoyment 10/10:
I absolutely loved this anime. With it's great paced romance, interesting characters and not too over the top settings and story, it's a relaxing, yet interesting anime that kept me smiling, laughing and crying. It does have some action, comedy and drama to it too, so it doesn't make you all depressed, but can be deep when it wants to. It just made me really happy in the end and, though I want a season 2, it isn't really necessary. It left me pleased, and that in itself is an achievement.
Overall 9/10:
Though it does have a few flaws within art, some unnecessary story and a few non-memorable characters, Soredemo sekai Wa utsukushii is a beautiful anime that will leave you smiling, awww-ing, crying and thinking ""despite the almost pedophilia, this anime is amazing!"". Definitely a recommended watch for all romance fans out there.",Positif
"for the review i give it a 9, but for me a 10. I love love love this anime. My #1 anime is Ouran HSHC and I could honestly say that this one rivals that almost top notch. It's that good.
I don't really know if it was Livius that got me started or the songs Nike sung, but I'm happy I got enraptured with this anime. It was very knew to me and I didn't know who Livius was because I saw it on a ""Recommend"" video on YT so I was like ""ohh.... an arranged marriage in a fantasy world between two obstinate
teens? Sign me up!"" and I loved every second of how wrong I was.
The songs and score were amazing and the plots gave where to character development. The hair bugged me from a little bit in the animation but I got over that it the 1st episode. So I would say to watch this anime because it's entertaining! <3",Positif
"I've tried watching all anime that aired this April 2014, sadly I didn't continue with all of those. Saying this as my personal opinion, I could say that some of those new series can be called ""boring and nonsensical"". I could also say that, Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii isn't like those anime that I dropped watching.
The first episode already caught my interest, I mean, it's definitely not typical for a romantic anime to have it's heroine older, taller and more mature than his leading man. This series is too cute. I just love the love-hate yet sweet relationship of the MC. The art is beautiful,
so is the voice of Nike.
This is pretty entertaining, some scenes are just nut cracker. I love the fact that this anime isn't just for entertainment, it has a deeper meaning to it. It reminds us that there is always beauty beneath every small things we take for granted, it tells us that despite everything, the world is still beautiful.
A romantic anime that doesn't have a typical plot. If you're looking for that, then this is for you.",Positif
"The synopsis is actually a little misleading in that it doesn't sound too interesting and a little wtf? to be honest. I mean, power to call rain? Right....However, the actual anime impressed me despite the lacklustre-sounding premise. In a nutshell, Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii is basically a character-driven romance anime. While watching, I was pleasantly surprised at the plot progression. Without spoiling anything, I can say that a mini-arc approach was taken where there was a central issue, usually involving some kind of politics, for each arc. The transition was smooth but more importantly, as a character-driven anime, we see how the main characters, Nike
and Livius, developed and how the romance grew between the (mismatched) pair. Another thing I liked about the story is how they managed to keep things simple while engaging. Each characters' motives were made very clear and it is very understandable why they chose to carry out the actions that they did. And again, about the rain summoning powers, I still do think it's somewhat cheesy but it is hardly a central focus of the anime. Of course it has its weak points. The lack of central objective/focus means that there is a very heavy reliance on the characters to carry the show, and also what I would call a loss of momentum as the show progressed. Although I would seem to be nitpicking as many slice of life shows do not indeed have any central aim, I felt like there was some kind of climax-resolution structure at around eps 4-5, after which it got a little boring and then picked up again.
It has got to be fortunate, then, that in this case the characters were able to carry the show, as Nike's hotheadedness and strong emotions (and naisu figurrrre oo yeah) complemented perfectly with Livius' cool and intelligence, with some nice mix-ups as the show progressed. Indeed, the main characters were hard not to like and to back them up there was a lively cast of entertaining side characters, like the trio of comical maids forever trying to stuff Nike into a corset.
The animation was alright, for sure it didn't have to be great for a simple slice-of-life kind of show, with some noticeable poorly-drawn scenes which hinted at a lack of budget, but that's not a big issue for me. Also the rain-calling song is pretty good, and fortunately so because they repeated it like 10 times throughout the anime and you can't exactly skip it like the OP/ED so yeah. Only complaint for the sound was how sometimes the bgm was too overpowering as if purposefully trying to convey the mood. That does not sit well with me as I feel like the voice-acting if done well should be more than enough for convey emotions. Then again, not completely convinced by the performance of either of the seiyuu for the 2 main characters, especially Nikes', but then again somewhat expected as she apparently does not have that much experience, so perhaps the bgm-cover-up was necessary.
Overall, not too bad. Heavy romance isn't really my cup of tea so maybe I would appear to be a little harsh with my final score.",Positif
"This anime was a very pleasant surprise. I had heard of it before, but was turned off since the main male character looked like a child. A few years later, I decided to give it a chance and I'm so glad that I did. If you're looking for an entertaining and heartwarming romance between a couple that don't seem compatible at first glance, then I would recommend this anime. My biggest complaint was that the anime was far too short.
Story [6]: Because the anime was given a measly 12 episodes, the quality of the story took a bit of a hit. The plot was fine
(and somewhat predictable), with meaningful scenes that really displayed the strength of the characters and the relationships with each other. However, every scene felt rushed and fleeting, not allowing the viewer to get carried away into the story before getting jerked into the next part of the story. Given the premise and the quality of the characters, there was a lot of potential to create a great experience for the viewer. I do have to give it some credit, the anime fit as much as they could within each episode. I will definitely read the manga after this.
Art [9]: I don't exactly know why, but this particular art style gives me a great deal of comfort. Compared to other anime where the characters are extremely cartoonish, the characters in this anime were extremely charismatic and relatable.
Sound [7]: The music was fine for the most part, I just found Nike's rain song to be a bit cheesy. Understandable since this anime came out a few years ago.
Character [9]: This would have to be my favorite aspect about this anime. I haven't seen too many shows with a young and cold male protagonist so I don't have too much to compare against, however I found Livius to be a refreshing character. Without dwelling too much on his past, we understand how his past shaped his personality and actions. He has a great mixture of the maturity forced upon him at an early age, the childlike desire he has when he thinks about Nike, and the warmth of the consideration he has for others. Nike's character is a bit more simplistic, however her character fits well with Nike. Her courage, honesty, and openness is exactly what Nike needs. Sometimes less is more.
Enjoyment [8]: Coming from a person that loves lighthearted stories that others may find to be boring, I enjoyed watching the anime and getting to know the characters.
Overall [8]: If you're looking for a story with a ton of depth and character development, this will be a bit disappointing. It wasn't due to the execution, but rather the lack of time to do so.",Positif
"I decided to watch this one after seeing all the praises it got here and after watching TBH I'm not sure why it got so many such praises in the first place. This seems like an attempt to make a combination of both shoujo and shounen genres but it ends-up with a show that is essentially jack of all trades, master of none.
Background: It's a story about the king on the sun kingdom, who managed to conquer most of the world even though he's still a child, and the princess of the rain kingdom, a poor country and one of the last places that remain
autonomous. The sun kingdom, as the name implies, always has sunshine and rain is something that people have heard of but never seen, so the king pretty much demands to marry one of the rain kingdom princesses, who have the unique ability to call the rain by singing songs. He initially treats the (very tomboyish) princess as a play toy but as time goes on a love story develops between them.
Why do I think it's just not that good? First because the shoujo love story is ""cliche by the book"", nothing but nothing makes it really unique, he treats her bad, he then falls in love with her, they have difficulties because of other etc. We've already seen all that, multiple times. So yeah, she can make it rain but that hardly plays a part in the development of the story. The fantasy and some swords that you see there appear as though they were put there just to avoid being a typical shoujo with no uniqueness at all, unfortunately without much success.
Art is great, no complaints here. Regarding sound, apart from the opening and ending themes (which are nice) the show has that thing of calling the rain by song so it's disappointing that the princess only sings one song that calls the rain, which you will hear over and over in almost every episode, to the point that it actually starts getting a little annoying.
Overall if you like cliche shoujo go ahead but if you're looking for shoujo with an actual twist then I don't think it really has that.",Positif
"First off: If you were going to turn away because of the obvious age difference and height difference between Nike and Livi, stick around until you finish reading this at least.
I recently finished reading a manga called 'Hapi Mari' about an arranged marriage. I quickly found out there was a whole genre of this specific cliche, so I got curious and did some research, during which this anime popped up. At first, I added it to my Plan to Watch and didn't really pay much attention to it until I came across it again weeks later. Curious, I read the summary to find the
Livi and Nike have an age and height difference. Usually, that wouldn't have bothered me if Livi wasn't so young. Because he is (and looks) like a child, I thought I would feel rather uncomfortable watching him parade around with a heroine that looks nearly like an adult. Somewhere in my head, however, something told me to go ahead and give it a try, so against my better judgment, I watched an episode to find myself pleasantly surprised.
While the 'arranged marriage' cliche is a tale as old as time, the slightly creative take on it leaves the story more fresh and fun to watch. Since it's only twelve episodes, the anime doesn't have a very overarching plot across it other than the romance, but for a rom-com anime, it isn't all that bad. It's nothing that hasn't been seen before, but it's unique enough to grab my (very-short) attention and hold it.
The art is very clean, colorful, and fun. I rarely come across art that I don't like, so this isn't really a problem. Most of the clothes and settings aren't very intricate,  which I would have liked to see, however.
Since the 'rain songs' are what the series centers around, they put some considerable effort into them. They aren't the best songs I've ever heard, but they can get me swaying a bit and are pretty catchy to say the least.
Livi's character, while not developed extensively, is pretty layered and fun to explore, especially since he's a child. While Nike is considerably flat, she is much more fun that most other heroines, especially because she's usually the one saving Livi.
I enjoyed this a lot! I binged it over the course of three days (I was also finishing a J Drama and working towards deadlines at the same time... procrastination at it's finest!) and I was extremely pleased with the entertainment I got as a result. :)
I will definetly be reading the manga as well!
I would recommend if: you like strong heroines, you like elemental powers, you like power-hungry children, you like rom-coms, you like kissing and awkward romance, the arranged marriage cliche
I would NOT recommend if: you are SEVERELY turned off by men being shorter/younger than women in relationships (I would still recommend watching an episode or two and giving it a try), you prefer darker themes, you don't really like romance or comedy, you're looking for something serious
As Livi himself says, the height difference between him and Nike won't last forever, so why all the worrying?
Have a great day guys!!! :D",Positif
"Art - 8
The art was really beautiful for me and i liked it a lot. The colours were bright, but not painful bright, just soft and nice grades. The colours of the characters hairs were well-painted, especially Livius'.
Sound - 10
The sound was amazing! The song of Nike is awesome and just her voice - beautiful! ,,Tender rain"" almost made me cry.
Characters - 7
*Spoilers*
Livius - This ,,kid"" is really interesting character. I think he is 15. He owns the world and this had made him a bit arrogant, cold and rough. Also his mother had died years ago and deep inside he is lonely and
sensitive. He changes later and becomes better person.
Nike - I am not sure about her age (probably 17). Nike is the youngest daughter of the rain country's king. She is cheerful, energetic and very kind. She is strong heroine and she isnt the typical cliche romance girl. Nike can stand for herself and she believes, that everything and everyone has beauty.
Neil - The cliche butler character, but he was funny one.
Ifrika - The cliche flirt/pervert of every shoujo. He makes the male main character jelaous.
Amaluna - The cliche girl, who wants to steal the love interest from MC.
The only problem to me is that Livi is younger than Nike and just too short.
Livius and Nike are great drawn up, but because of all these cliche characters i will give it 7 mark.
Enjoyment - 9
I fell in love with this anime! The romance is so cute and heart-warming. Its beautiful, filled with feels, tears and humor.
Overall - 10
I really recomend you this anime, because it will show you that the world really is still BEAUTIFUL!",Positif
"Princess Nike has the power to call the rain with her singing. She is sent off to a land that hasn't seen rain in order to marry King Livius, a boy whom is much younger than she is. The plot itself is original and quite beautiful, and the song that Nike sang in almost every episode was a pleasure to listen to. Whenever that familiar tune was cued, a smile was brought to my face.
It was a little weird at first to watch Nike fall in love with someone who was much younger than her, but I got used to it and came to love
the anime. I loved how the comedy in this anime was lowkey - that made it even funnier when something comical happened.
Throughout the anime I found little to no flaws. It was the perfect amount of romance and comedy. But... then the ending came. This is the reason the show didn't get a perfect score. The ending of this anime was so dissatisfying that it made me furious. And it's not that the show ended uncompleted, it was the WAY it ended. I don't want to say anything else in fear of spoiling, but if you plan on watching this anime, I suggest you prepare for the most disappointing ending in your life.",Positif
"Story (10/10):
There's not much of a plot, it mostly creates a story around the genres. There's a few action scenes. If you're looking for an anime that focus' more on romance, this is the anime for you! I found this anime really cute! It intrigued me since episode 1. The story also shows some aspects of reality. Especially, in terms of romance.
Art (8/10):
It was aired on 2014, the art isn't really that great, but it's still pretty! Sure, there are a lot of anime that was aired on 2014 & the art looks amazing, but the story makes up for it. It honestly, really isn't
that bad.
Sound (10/10):
I just really love the OST! This anime is one of the anime's where I like both the opening & ending song.
Character (10/10):
Their characters are great! I can't really tell what kind of personality Nike has, though. Even though Livius' personality was cliche, I still found it adorable! I'm pretty sure he's a tsundere! I actually got attached to Livi because of his personality & his looks. So kawaii.
Enjoyment (10/10):
One of the best romance anime's I've ever seen! Not exaggerating, fyi. I actually re-watched this twice, because it was that good. This had me fangirling at 12AM. Yes, I even went to the extremes & rewatched it at 12AM.
Overall (10/10):
This is one of the best romance anime's I've ever seen. The story may not have much of a plot though it makes you intrigued by events and it focuses on the genres. The art was not so bad, though it could've been better, in my opinion. I really love the OST, it really fits well in the anime & the genres. I never skipped the opening & the ending. The characters, I guess are okay. I couldn't really tell Nike's personality & Livius has a cliche one. Though, I don't really mind. I still love their characters. They are just so adorbs... I rewatched this twice. It's so hard to find an anime with this kind of chemistry & unique plot.",Positif
"The World Is Still Beautiful
Art
I wasn’t really sure how I was going to feel about this art. It seemed really generic and at times I was afraid it might take a turn for the worst. But instead I really just got used to it and I ended up finding it to be rather simple but still elegant. The colors come out really well and there is great contrast at times. I really loved when, in the darker moments of the story, there was a real fear that came about as a result of the way everything had shifted to a darker tone. The other thing
I noticed was the amount of animation quirks that make for some kind of comic relief. Personally, I’m not a huge fan of these and I think it was overused here.
Sound
The soundtrack is amazing. If they sold this online somewhere I would buy it, it is that good. I absolutely love the pirate style tunes and the shanty type things that you hear as the series opens. The biggest thing it reminded me though, was of the video game series Kingdom Hearts. A lot of the music sounds like it would fit right in at Traverse Town (if you’ve played the game you’ll understand). Another thing I really liked about the music was when Nike’s singing came into play as a part of the story. This really was a great way to include even more music in this show and I think it really paid off in the end.
Story
The story here is that Princess Nike, of the Rain Dukedom, is sent off to marry the Sun King in the Sun Kingdom, where it never rains. Upon the discovery that the Sun King, Livi, is just a child and has the selfish motive of wanting her to become his play thing (making it rain whenever he pleases as a party favor) she reacts...poorly and Livi throws her in prison. Once she escapes, they begin to have this relationship and Livi starts to learn to see the beauty in the world of the stars, flowers and the earth; rather than all of the harm that it has caused him and the obsession with money and power. Once the King’s true colors come out, their relationship is actually able to grow and flourish and become something that really wasn’t expected.
Personal Reflection
So I was pretty unsure about this show. Almost every show I watch, I go in blind, but for the reasons I stated above I was a little weary on this one. However the more that I watched the better I felt about it. The relationship between Livi and Nike is very much like that of Lawrence and Holo from Spice and Wolf (another great show if you haven’t seen it). But as I grew into the characters I felt them grow into me as well. I wanted to see them get together and have a relationship of true love, because that is what I seek in life. My main gripe with the show was some translation errors (such as the title of the show being translated weird) and there were many episode titles that were off. Now I haven’t decided if that is the studio’s fault or Crunchyroll’s, either way it was annoying. This show gave me a warm fuzzy feeling, but it also was a little rough at times and I decided to watch other things. It didn’t drag me in as some other amazing shows do. But if you need a love story that has drama, singing, and even a few tears, just remember; The World Is Still Beautiful.
Overall Rating: 7.5/10",Positif
"I've read the manga up till volume 17, chapter 95. When I saw this was also turned into an anime I was quite excited since the manga was fun to read. But I got worried when I saw it was only 12 episodes long.
The story is there, a lot of useless filler is cut out since they have to squeeze the manga down to 22 minute chunks. But the basic story is there and it flows well. Of course the anime feels rushed because of this, their romance is rushed because it takes out a lot of filler moments.
The artwork is beautiful, I like it
more then in the manga. I mean there are some obvious ""silly"" moments where the characters are supposed to look bad so it looks bad there but it's supposed to be bad.
The music was lovely. Every time Nike sang, I got shivers and it actually stirred some emotions in me. I think this anime did it's best in the music.
Characters are fine. We don't get a lot of time with them given we only have 12 episodes, so I can't really say much here.
I enjoyed watching the anime, I think it pairs well with the manga.
Overall a good anime. However I am disappointed that it only had 12 episodes and only showed the first 4 volumes of the manga. These volumes are some of the more boring ones when compared to some of the later ones. So it's a real shame we couldn't get more episodes showing some of the better volumes (the desert trip comes to mind).
I'm not sure if the anime didn't get good ratings or if they stopped because they didn't have enough material to continue the story at that time but I'd love to see a second season of this anime. I think it deserves it!",Positif
"This anime, Soredemo Sekai wa Utskushii is a beautiful show that starts off as a diplomatic marriage that transpires into love, personally, I haven't seen many, if any anime that have used this story, but everything about this anime just pulled it together and made it harmonize perfectly. The art style was perfect I loved how the rain, clouds, and sun looked and I love how the artist(s) added feeling to every aspect.
The singing was absolutely brilliant, the lines mixed perfectly with what was happening at all times, it felt like the songs themselves told a story.
The voice acting and the characters were very lovable,
especially Neil and Bard. I loved the comedy aspects that were added into the series.
But most of all, I love how they prioritized the romance in the show, they've made it become a really good romance anime that I will always keep in mind.",Positif
"One of the best anime, I have watched till now. it was very beautiful like the title itself... People who haven't watched it, i recommand should definitely watch it.. Best romance/adventure/fantasy anime. I hope there will be season 2.. Even if its not so popular, I know there are fans who are loyal to this anime. and I hope' we get a new season because we want to know more and see more of Livius & Nike's love life. And mainly wanna see Livi grow into a fine man for our Nike.
Thank you Shiina Dai sensei for this beautiful masterpiece!!!
We Love your work :)
May you
fulfill your loyal fans request",Positif
"Welcome into the world of songs and gushing love. Clearly the direction of this anime is to satisfy the hole that the lonely anime viewer experiences.
The art style is neat and unadventurous, there are no huge fight scenes or tricky trickery to be had. And the story? Typical fish out of water following love story. That said, the character breadth is truly outstanding and I feel that they were wasted in some part. We have two strong and relatable protagonists, Nike and Livi and what a pair these two make.
The jokes almost flow from each persons predicament, ruined only but the occasional overpowering possessiveness that
Livi sometimes exposes. The drama is dealt with on a episode by episode nature and at the end of the whole mess, if you've bothered to sit through some of the more cringe-worthy scenes, you exit the anime with a slight skip in your heart.
Overall, an entertaining way to pass a weekend or two. You'll wish love was only that easy and perhaps be embolden to greater things, but only for a weekend or two.",Positif
"Most anime I watch are completed simply for the sake of completing it, because I made a vow to myself never to list an anime in my own list as ""dropped"" the moment I started it.
Nichijou will never be one of those types of anime. It is amazing. Never in my life have I watched an anime filled with so much randomness. Even Lucky Star which has held the undisputed king of randomness anime spot on my list has been dethroned within minutes of the first episode being aired.
This is my first review BTW so forgive me if this review sucks or anything. All the
ratings are just my personal opinion
Story: 10/10
I give 10/10 in story for an anime which has no story, but this is precisely why it is so damn amazing. There are jokes placed at almost every corner of each episode, with the timing of each being so perfect that I wonder how much time the producers take to come up with each joke at each precise timing. And where else can one find anime that has people bringing in machine guns to school, riding a goat to school, or even wrestling a deer in school? And I haven't even gone to what happens outside of school. I have found myself laughing time and again that my mother has knocked on my door plenty of times to find me in a laughing fit.
Art: 9/10
The art is not perfect, I've seen animes with slightly better art than this, but I find this kind of artwork suits this anime very well. It looks simple at times but it fits in very well, while scenes that required plenty of details are, well, very detailed. I find myself to be rather amazed by the artwork at times.
Sound: 10/10
With such a wide cast of characters it's gotta be hard to find good VAs for every character who can bring out their true personality and colour, but thankfully they have done it. Most characters, if not all, have VAs that have successfully portrayed their characters style and personality, while others have not gotten enough air time for me to determine that. The BGM is great too, often going well with the scene that is going at that moment.
Character: 10/10
I love the characters here. Yuuko as the dumb one, Mio as the sensible one always keeping Yuuko in check, and Mai as the silent one who always own Yuuko (and sometimes Mio) in whatever she does. These 3 make the perfect combination within the confines of their classroom. Outside the classroom, however, we have Hakase the childish one (literally), Nano the caretaker robot who is oft abused by Hakase, and Sakamoto the cat as the one maintaining the sensibility within the household. And not forgetting the side characters, the teacher (whose name I don't remember) who is scared of students, the goat rider whose looks reminds me of Katsuragi Keima of The World God Only Knows, the mohawk guy, and the principal, among many others. All of these characters converge together to make one of the most entertaining animes I have ever watched.
P.S. Sakamoto is my favourite. The moment he made his introductory speech I knew I was going to love him, and he hasn't disappointed
Enjoyment: 10/10
Need I say more? This entire review has been about how great this show is and how much I enjoyed it.
Overall: 10/10
This anime is very very much enjoyable, but it probably is not suited for people who don't like randomness anime, who'd rather be able to tell what's going to happen next. This is personal preference, and as a person who watches a lot of such animes filled with randomness, I have to say it's one of the best such animes I've watched.",Positif
"Being a KyoAni project, the first thought that came into my mind when I saw the cover art for Nichijou was that it is going to be a comedy/slice of life filled with cute girls doing cute things. Luckily, there's much more to this anime. Nichijou is a sketch comedy, with a sprinkle of slice of life, set in a junior high school. While the title in English is ""My Ordinary Life"", Nichijou is full of the extraordinary.
There are two main plot threads going on throughout Nichijou. The first follows the trio of Yuuko, Mio and Mai as they try to get through the
year at school. The second follows the Professor, her cat, Sakamoto and her robot, Nano as they attempt to run a working household together. Alone, these stories are enough to carry the series. However, this is a sketch comedy with recurring characters. A feature of sketch comedies with recurring characters is that each character gets their own story. Hence, Nichijou manages to have many short stories throughout the series involving many of the side characters in addition to the main ones. This means that, unlike what most people say, Nichijou has a lot more plot than people realise.
Upon initial viewing, it takes a while to get accustomed to the style of comedy. However, after being acclimatised to the randomness and energetic scenes, the show will become enjoyable. Of course, comedy is going to be reliant on one's sense of humour, so if this isn't down your alley, then it won't work. But for the majority of people most sketches in this show will hit the mark and have everyone laughing. The sketches themselves are mostly based around usual occurrences at schools, for example, forgetting one's homework or having a crush on a guy. However, Nichijou is also willing to go to the extraordinary with situations like the school principal fighting a deer or the ""tsundere"" trope being taken to the extreme where she uses missile launchers instead of the usual ""B-BAKA!"". By setting the tone early, this series manages to not only feel like these sketches belong together, but the stories themselves intertwine as each episode progresses.
The technical aspects of the show help sell the comedy. The animation flows extremely well, which is quite surprising for a comedy, but it allows for the slapstick scenes to be as high octane as the creators want it to be. There isn't much of a soundtrack to the show, however the sound effects add to each scene well. One of the drawbacks is that each character's design is quite similar, especially for the girls. Almost all of them have the same body shape and face, where the only differences are the hair style. Also what can be a negative is when the girls get into shouting matches that their high pitched voices can be quite intense.
Overall, the best part of Nichijou is the world it creates. The characters and setting are fleshed out well and feel like a real place; even with the bizarre events that occur frequently. The show isn't just all comedy; there are many touching moments throughout which helps one empathise and connect with the characters while perhaps teaching a few lessons on being a good friend. That's not to say it's a tearjerker, but it will remind viewers of the troubles they went through in high school and how they dealt with it. However, the show's message is quite basic; friendship can make everything fun and can help people get through difficult times.
I would recommend this show for everyone who enjoys lighthearted anime, but it must be noted that one's sense of humour must be considered first before deciding whether to watch the show. For people that do enjoy a comedy set in a high school and full of energy, Nichijou is a must watch. Now I join the many fans who are hoping for a second season.",Positif
"This review will be hard to write, as I will probably laugh at certain parts.
Story: 8
So... Nichijou isn't much of a story, rather a collection of short stories, a bunch of them.  These short stories are divided based on the characters. In the beginning we have mainly separate stories all happening around the same time, but are not interconnected.  I found this a bit boring, just a collection of stories with characters who had no idea the other characters of the anime existed.  Towards the end though, the stories become interconnect as the characters meet each other. These episodes were more interesting,
seeing the stories all fitting together.
The only parts I didn't really enjoy were the Helvetica Standard, the humor was to weird or didn't have enough context for it to be funny (At least to me)
Art: 10
The art of Nichijou at first glance is very simplistic, but as you watch more episodes, you will notice the different art styles used in Nichijou.  Nichijou covers a multitude of genres, with the art matching whatever genre the short story is about.  The art and animation for scenes such as Mio losing it or Mai and Yuuko playing coin soccer are some of the best art.
Sound: 8
Both OPs are very catchy and addicting to listen to.  The first ED was really good as well, but I found the other 6 EDs used during the second half of the series not as enjoyable.  The background music was nice, with a few added to my music playlist.  The background music help set the mood for each short story.
Character: 9
Characters were all enjoyable, with very unique roles.  My favorite being Nano, as she is a very mature character with a bunch of moe.  Maturity and moe?  What.  The only problem was character development, there is none, but it doesn't matter much in an anime like this.  Misato taking Tsundere to another level as well.
Enjoyment: 10
Boy I wish I could rate this higher, I enjoyed this anime so much.  There so many parts in where I: questioned what happen, laughed hysterically, and stared blankly as I was speechless.  These all kept my attention and was very enjoyable.
Overall: 10
One of the best if not the best comedies I have seen, in where I will definitely rewatch.",Positif
"I'm going to start out by saying this my favourite anime. It has made me laugh when I did not have the energy to talk, it has let me escape reality when I did not want to exist. Whenever I try looking for comedy anime similar, common recommendations like Lucky Star and Azumanga Daioh appear a lot. Danshi Koukousei comes close, but Nichijou is an experience that outshines all of these by quite a margin. There is really no definitive genre to put this show in other than comedy, it is almost the epitome of it, because that's all it is: simple pure ecstasy.
Enjoyment:
It
explores humour in ways I could not begin to imagine. For the most part, Nichijou uses the ""traditional"" anime gag style of comedy. This efficiency of this method has always befuddled me because it exploits the core of why humans find things funny (the unexpected action), but follows it up by breaking the golden rule of comedy (explaining/calling out the joke). Then this anime takes this already uniquely unprecedented brand of humour and blasts it at full volume, and even the tsukkomi becomes the joke. So the natural conclusion was that Nichijou's funniness comes for its major amplification of gag humour to the point where every single punchline just jumps at you. Yet, rewatching it for the third time still held up as well, if not better, than the first time. Perhaps it is the amazing voice acting, after all, one could make an entire soundboard out of the sounds these characters make. Then the series throws a fastball at me with an entire skit completely without speech, which is just as funny as every other skit. Well-paced, well-executed, Nichijou's comedy is done to a t in every technical aspect, and downright hysterical in practical implementation. And all while  being astoundingly comical, it is, at all the right places, beautifully heart-warming, more so in the second half (see: Episode 26), with a deep message of positivity and optimism.
Art:
Undoubtedly, amazing. Moe stylings mixed with grand production value, breathtaking backgrounds and effects, fluid animation that competes with Madhouse's sakuga and makes 2D animation look like it was rendered straight from Maya, so amazingly capture the essence of the series it could bring a tear to my eye. It is unlike KyoAni's usual work, yet, weirdly, I feel only they could've pulled off Arawi Keiichi brilliant vision and absurd hilarity.
Sound:
All music was perfect in their usage – from the background compositions that carry along the slice of life and school anime feel, to the memorable sounds used for recurring sections, and that one time they used an emotional vocalised song during a ridiculous skit of Mio training for high jump. Another thing that captured my attention was the sound design and engineering. As mentioned before, the voice acting is riotously done, but how they time it and fit it with the music and visuals, adding effects and certain points, most notably when they repeat screams in succession, is brilliant. As for the openings and endings, Hyadain was a flawless choice, with his upbeat, well-produced and cheerful sound, much like the show itself, while Sayaka Sasaki's calm and melodious vocals add to that heart-warming factor. The choice to change ending songs every episode for the second half was also bold and very fitting.
Character:
I could rant on and on about the cast. Every single character is remarkably unique and enjoyable to watch, every single one, secondary or tertiary. And oddly, in a world where unexplainably random and outlandish events are occurring, they are to an extent, believable. In the way that they are not stuck with a singular trait, they each have quirks that stray from their definitive role, and switch up their position between interactions. This is perhaps why I enjoyed it more rewatching it. Understandably, with so much happening to so many people at an unbelievable pace, especially for people used to, frankly, normal anime, it is difficult to connect with the characters early on the first time around. It is even more fun watching them act when you already know and love them.
Overall:
It is simply a show created to make you smile, no matter the situation. And it succeeds. I understand why some people might not like it, but I am absolutely, unequivocally in love with this anime.",Positif
"Nichijou is a one-of-a-kind anime that exists not only to represent everyday life, but a wide array of social, emotional, relate-able, and some times down right daft modern day plights. As a generalization for anyone who can't be asked to read all of this: Nichijou is a bold, up-beat, masterfully crafted, immensely funny, refreshing; cartoon-esc take on modern day life. It breaks through the typical barriers of the SoL genre and breathes new life into the term ""ordinary"" -
As you will find out, if you watch: Nichijou is quite far fetched at times; as it seamlessly makes instant transitions from extremely dramatic, to extremely
comedic, and maybe even to sad - all the drop of a hat!
Rendering it FAR from just, ""ordinary life"": which is probably what you expected when you came here.
So! All in favor of a SliceOLife/Action/Romance/Comedy/Adventure/Drama/Fantasy/Moe/SciFi..... -The list goes on forever and so that's likely why it's packaged so deceivingly as a stereotypical SoL.
Nichijou doesn't major in a strung out, perplexing story line. Therefore rendering it as an episodic show for the most part, which works wonders for the vibrant, and somewhat abstract presentation method it utilizes so well: compiling countless, effectively crafted, short-story scenes that keep the viewer engaged, on top of encompassing a massive spread of genres as a whole.
In terms of presentation, Nichijou emphasizes in an action and cartoon-like manor: a variety of cliche anime techniques, often for the purpose of looking ridiculous. Thus making everything very engaging, and appealing to people of all ages. If i were to name this approach, it would definitely be ""OTT"" (over the top) - which, if you understand what i'm getting at here, should give you an idea of how it comes across as such a hilarious show.
On the topic of comedy, i'm not joking (get it), It's great  how the show makes use of so much effective (primarily) slapstick material; without detracting ATALL from the characters and atmosphere. As a pre-warning, don't watch unless you're free to laugh out loud wherever you may be ;)
Statistic related stuff now (yay of course)...
For both Art and Sound, i see No flaws - as the animation style is adaptive and makes great use of current situation, in turn, greatly helping to enhance the way in which the show conveys feelings. While the use of sound is always appropriate in similar ways.
Note: I think the intro sequences are Top Notch!
As you should already be aware, i can't exactly mark extraordinarily in terms of story or development detail, as it's not THAT kind of show, which is a blessing really, having enjoyed all of it myself.
To conclude... The craftsmanship, the abstract presentation, story concepts, comedy all equate to... and i can't stress it enough here: a brilliantly entertaining, laid back show like None I've ever seen before.
So i ask EVEN of those who dislike SoLs to give it a go, as, again: it may as well have a genre of its own.",Positif
"Nichijou: My Ordinary Review
Nichijou, aka. My Ordinary Life is quite a contradiction. This anime is far from ordinary and the best way I can describe it is pure insanity. In fact, this anime is so insane that it is actually quite ingenious.
The story of Nichijou is pretty simple. It's split up between the somewhat bizarre every day happenings of three high school girls (Yuuko, Mio, and Mai) in one half of the story and the comical struggles of a robotic girl having to take care of her child professor and talking cat (Nano, Hakase, and Sakamoto). While a majority of the anime focuses around
these six characters, there are quite a few short segments that focus in the supporting characters and in most cases, these segments will happen randomly within the narrative. Usually I'm not a big fan of when side story interrupts a flowing narrative, but in this case, it works. The main narrative isn't necessary deep and focuses MUCH more on comedy than storytelling. Nichijou's setup is best described much like an episode of Monty Python. It's made up of a bunch of sketches that somehow make up about a half-hour of hilarity at a time. Although, unlike Monty Python, Nichijou does actually have a narrative.
The artwork I'd say is decent. The animation itself isn't stunning in graphical nature. However, what it lacks in flashiness, it makes up in creativity. How this series is animated is perfect for the nature of this series. It's cartoonishly comical in it's animation and it's just what the doctor ordered for this series.
On top of that, the opening and ending sequences are just gorgeous. The opening sequences for both the first half and second half set the mood perfectly. When you see the opening, you know you're in for a crazy, comical, and downright wild ride from start to finish. What I found interesting though was the ending sequence. I actually thought ZZZ was one of the better anime endings I have ever seen with its joyful and downright artistic feel. It feels almost as if you're watching the dream sequence of a young child. While I can't necessarily say it ""fits"" the anime, what I can say is despite that, the concept was certainly brilliant and kudos to the production team that put it together.
The voice acting was downright spectacular. This is one of the few animes I've ever watched where I didn't feel like a single character was miscast. One rather unique concept this anime picked up was for the previews, they'd take a random object from the episode, give it its own personality and voice over from guest stars. I was amazed at some of the star power they were even able to pick up, including Aya Hirano, Yui Horie, and Tomokazu Seki just to name a few. The passion that was put behind the voice acting in this series was just incredible to see in action, from the major roles to even the smallest of minor roles.
Of all the things that made this anime click, I felt the characters were the strongest. The main characters were certainly interesting to watch. You had Yuuko the clumsy, dumbstruck girl with a fun personality, Mio the incredibly obsessive, short tempered, but forgiving girl and Mai, the quiet oddball that seems more concerned with her own world than others around her. The other side of the main cast was great as well. You had Nano the self-conscious, yet dutiful robotic girl that serves as the caretaker for Hakase, an extremely intelligent, yet childish scientist, and Sakamoto, a stray cat that's taken in by them and gains the ability to talk by wearing a scarf. The main characters were great and I can tell you the supporting characters were just as fantastic. I rolled in laughter just about any time Sasahara appeared with his wealthy and poetic mannerisms or when Takahashi-sensei embarrassingly obsessed over Sakurai-sensei.
If there is one thing I really didn't like about Nichijou as a series, it would be how it ended. I found the final episode to be rather weak for a series finale. I could tell that the writers were really hoping to keep this going with a second season but was unfortunately discontinued due to poor sales. It really is such a shame because I felt the plot itself for the most part wasn't bad and there were open ends to many of the characters side stories. It did a pretty good job of rapping up Nano's story and perhaps Mio's as well (although that one is open for debate).
Overall, if you're looking for an anime that's chaotically hilarious, you can find none better than Nichijou. The creativity behind Nichijou is purely astounding and I'd even go so far to say that this is perhaps the best comedy series I have ever seen. What it did surprisingly well was advertise itself as a pure comedy but somehow implemented surprising slice-of-life elements where you wouldn't expect them. While I did watch this series for laughs, I found myself enjoying each character's on-going narrative and was invested in their outcomes. All-in-all, Nichijou's comedy might not be for everyone. However, I am willing to bet even the stiffest of stiffs would find something to chuckle at in this series.",Positif
"Nichijou is a slice of life comedy that was produced by Kyoto Animation, the company behind the production of very popular shows in the same genre - such as K-ON! and Lucky Star - but also other works like Clannad (in conjunction with Key), and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzymiya. That said, all of these shows had some sort of genius behind them, and Nichijou is the same way.
*Very minor character spoilers in the paragraph below - nothing really detrimental to the story in my opinion*
Nichijou's cast is quite lovable to say the least. The show is initially divided into three groups.
The first
is the Shinonome Laboratory group, consisting of Hakase Shinonome (a really cute but attention seeking kid-professor), her robot, Nano Shinonome (who ultimately wants to be like an ordinary teenaged girl), and their cat (a cat who talks due to one of Hakase's inventions; tries to be mature).
The second is composed of three really awesome friends in high school: Yuuko (a somewhat stupid girl with some really stupid logic, but has some good things going for her), Mio (practically the opposite of Yuuko [complimentary], but shares some of Yuulo's flaws as well), and Mai (Nichijou's resident troll ; practically the catalyst for many of the skits and jokes).
The third is a wide array of side characters, such as Tachibana Misato (Nichijou's resident Tsundere, who, somehow, has many rocket launchers, turrents, and a P90 at her disposal), her crush, Sasahara Koujirou (a character that sorta comes off as a douchebag but has some redeeming undertones to his personality), Sakurai Izumi (a shy, reserved homeroom teacher who is naturally a pushover), and Manabu Takasaki (a teacher that crushes on Sakurai, but epicly fails during encounters he has with her).
While this may seem like a lot of characters to get a grasp of, you are given an 'almost equal' taste (in the way of skits) of each group in every single episode and in no particular order. (I do say 'almost equal' because the story tends to favor the first two groups more - this makes sense since the third group are considered supporting roles, but I feel that their roles in the show go way past the expectations of supporting roles.) In watching how they carry out their lives, express themselves, interacting with each other, by the end of the series, you'll have a great feel for the characters and the roles their friends play in their lives. One of the major themes in Nichijou is friendship, which the story does a good job showing us. You will find that Nichijou has some serious, heartwarming moments that not only compliment the feel of the show, but also the feel for each of the characters.
Slice of life comedies put a lot of emphasis on humor rather than plot, which is where the genre gets lost for some. Nichijou, while not necessarily plot driven, does contain a more concrete story in the second half of the series. In fact, while we're only given a little bit of plot, it does not feel 'half-assed' in any way as it does drive many of the skits along, and it also helps put a really nice and sweet ending to the show (though some may argue that it was a bit underwhelming).
I do feel like it is worth mention that Nichijou sorta reserves the right to gets away with it's minimal plot as the literal translation for the name 'Nichijou' in English is 'Ordinary Life,' or more colloquially, 'Everyday Life'. That is what this show does, depict the everyday life of the cast - nothing more, nothing less. Adding all these thoughts up, I think Nichijou met my expectations content wise.
There is no doubt that Nichijou looks a bit different, but who says that's a bad thing. It is important to note that Nichijou's designs are almost completely taken from the manga it originated from. That said, while it may not feature the most favorable designs, it does make sense for the show in that it helps convey the same feel as the original, intended work.
This 'animated comic book' like feel, in my opinion, compliments the type of story Nichijou actually is - its light, fun, not meant to be taken seriously - and adds to the whole mindset that anything can happen in the show. That said, Kyoto Animation really out did themselves with the animation and production quality of this show.
Nichijou is fitted with all sorts of skits. For one, you have these really simple interactions between the characters. Animation on these, as expected, is practically flawless. However, a large part of Nichijou's claim to fame is due in part to its very overdramatic, hyper, overproduced, but ridiculously hilarious slapstick skits. Quite literally, you'll get all of these epic 3D camera movements, and epic, vivid explosions on many occasions - often for stupid things (for example, saving a piece of food from hitting the floor). Not only that, but its fits shockingly well with the comic art style. This is where I, as well as many other people agree that KyoAni did all of this random stuff, not because it was necessary, but because they simply can. Actually, some may even go as far as saying that KyoAni decided to play the mad scientist and made stuff happen just for the hell of it. I really cannot stress enough that all of the art, this included, contributes greatly to the overall comedic execution within Nichijou. For that, I really praise KyoAni for their work on this.
Speaking of comedy, I feel that Nichijou is one of the funniest shows I've seen yet, however, it is not all that perfect. There are going to be times when the jokes end up flying over your head and make you wonder whether or not the particular skit was supposed to make you laugh or not. This should not deter you from watching though. I cannot stress enough that the vast majority of the jokes will have you ROFLing, as Nichijou's execution is top notch (some may say one of the best in the business), particularly in timing -after all, it is everything - and the ordering of the skits in particular episodes (hell, at some point you may see a funny skit cross an episode, which was a pretty hilarious surprise in my opinion). In fact, it can be pretty safe to say that this show has ways to surprise you with jokes, which definitely can definitely keep you watching.
While I don't want to go on about the music (I'm going to totally omit talking abou the BGM), the two OPs the show has to offer are both crazy earworms. I personally love them as the hyper feel compliments the show very well. Additionally, I love the how KyoAni sequenced both OPs together with awesome pans and editing. I don't remember loving a sequence this much since Lucky Star's OP and the very popular Hare Hare Yukai ED from THAT other KyoAni work. If there is anything a reader will pick on, it is this portion (opinions are opinions), so I'll end the music talk here.
If you could not tell from, what I think is, the overwhelming amounts of praise from the paragraphs above, I really enjoyed Nichijou. Truth is, I really love slice of life shows. The fact that they are not plot driven, fun, and entertaining makes it my 'go-to' genre when I don't have the time to watch plot heavy shows - especially with this being my senior year in high school. Fact of the matter is that Nichijou is my favorite slice show at the moment, mainly because it can act as a pick-me-up and/or aid in procrastination with the random skits it has, but I can also choose to focus on the minor plot if I really want to watch something with a little more substance.
Lastly, I find it sad that this show flopped in Japan. While it seems popular here on MAL, Nichijou got knocked off it's primetime slot mid-series, and missed its sales quota in Japan by a lot (it sold less than 2,000 Blu-Ray and DVDs). Ultimately, this kills all chances for a second season, which I and many others would have liked to see. Many attribute Nichijou's failure to the fact that it was not produced to market to the masses - something K-ON did with it's moe-style feel and practically was a smash hit.
I don't know the truth behind KyoAni and Nichijou, but it seems as if they created a masterpiece, if not something close, and did it without thinking about catering to the mainstream - did it for the sake of creating something awesome, not for the sake of profit. Maybe its just me wanting to justify KyoAni's failure, but either way, the fact that the intended market left Nichijou unappreciated just doesn't sit well for me. This show is awesome to say the least, and I do wish it would catch on in Japan. But it is what it is I guess.

I'd appreciate it if any readers out there could give me feedback on this review as it would be extremely helpful for whenever I decide to make another review in the future.

"Every so often there comes a show that just works. It doesn't necessarily have to try too hard, it doesn't have to present complex themes, unique characters, or a well written story (or even a story at all.) No sometimes simplicity is perfect in its own right.
Nichijou is one of these shows.
I'm not going to mince words here; Nichijou is a bare bones experience. It has no story. It has no character development. It has no overarching themes or messages it intends to convey. Its sole purpose is to make you laugh, and I'll be damned if it didn't make split my sides at points.
Nichijou manages to touch all the comedic bases at once while maintaining its fresh style and humor throughout, and is all around a supremely enjoyable experience.
Nichijou translates to something around ""My Ordinary Life"". While there is no story, we can find a somewhat discernible ""arc"" around the character of Nano, a robot built by the child professor Hakase. We see her attempting to fit into an ordinary life despite the massive key lodged in her back, along with the other various accouterments she possesses as a robot. But in all reality, Nichijou is a series of comedic skits and set-pieces, some of which are connected. The skits are always (at the least) funny, if not gut busting endeavors that still amuse me to no end now. The humor here ranges from high to low, and I am sure if I actually understood the jokes that play on Japanese experiences, I would find it even more entertaining. I still love it though; its a sketch comedy show at its finest.
Character wise the show has a multitude of figures fleshing out the cast. The main characters (Nano, Hakase, Sakamoto [talking cat], Yuuko [best girl], Mio [other best girl], and Mai [really they're all best girl]) take up the ""Nichijou"" segments of the show, which can be considered the main act in this sketch adventure. Other colorful and fun characters are as bountiful as they are colorful (I wont spoil the fun of experiencing all their quirks for the first time by going too into detail) , and you'll come to enjoy, in time, the segments diverting away from our main cast that focus on the seminal cast of secondary figures. It's one menagerie of excellence, let me tell ya kiddos.
Art and sound wise the production quality holds up remarkably well to the quality of the show's writing. At times the animation is actually pretty damn amazing, which it doesn't really need to be considering it's a slice of life comedy show. The soundtrack is also light-hearted and fresh, perfectly complementing the show when it needs to. Really its the perfect compliment to an already perfect show.
Maybe Nichijou isn't as objectively brilliant as some of the more traditional classics out there, but there's something to be said for a show that does everything it sets out to do perfectly. It might not be necessarily original, but it most certainly is funny as all heck. I love this show. Nichijou is truly a-

"Selemat pagi?
Watched 13 episodes.
Story: 3, Poor
The story is, there is none. This is a slice of life anime without story. I really have trouble watching Anime without story development.
What is great about this anime if anything. It's unfledged Comedy. But it's very Random Comedy. But so funny. If you don't mind a anime without story and just great comedy. Watch this. It's just a lot of side stories and random comedy. GREAT COMEDY!
It shows 2 groups of people in to different stories. One is 3 girls in School. Other is 1 Kid Girl, whom made a robot teenager girl to take care of
her that's living with their cat.
Then, it's 1 or I think 2 more groups. 1 Girl that is a Gun Maniac. And another with a guy and girl that's alone in a club doing nothing. Well, one girl reads a book while the other guy trying to figure out what to do or to save his club from getting disbanded for to few members.
And now and then, side stories about more people.
As you can hear, it's SO boring. But yea, personal opinion.
Art: 10, Outstanding
The art is fantastic! It might not be the preferred style, everyone look pretty childish, but that is a fitting must for this Comedy, Slice of Life.
Anyway.. Totally outstanding Art. Very detailed and well performed art. It's really concentrated to reinforce the Animes Comedy. And does it so well.
On this area, you will not be dissatisfied, unless you don't like this art style they used.
Sound: 10 Outstanding
Wow, I mean. The Opening is just so fitting. Very well fitting Song for this Anime, and the background music during all the jokes is superb. Everything for the Comedies best. Very good voice acting. It's legendary. Love the childish voice for Hakase. It's unfledged.
MANY sound effects for even the smallest things. Like when people get nervous, they amplified the art showing nervousness with sound. It's EPIC.
Character: 8, Very Good
It's so many characters at such a short time. All characters and even supportive characters have a remember-able personality. The Main characters are epically done and well thought out. Like Hakase is a super smart professor that have made a teenage robot girl that takes care of her. It's really weird she made a robot but in the series, she does nothing else than being a baby girl. She is 8 year old.
Many could fall in love with these characters. The Main 2 Groups that makes somewhat of story..
Yuuko is a lively girl whom sucks at school. Always having troubles.
Mai is a school nerd and says almost nothing.
Mio is an average girl who from time to time likes to be playful.
These three does a lot together, Yuuko being the one bringing the trouble, Mai the one that solves everything, and Mio just Average.
Hakase is an 8year old girl whom made Nano and acts like any 8 year old girl.
Nano is the created teenage girl. Who acts like Hakases mother but wishes for an average teenage life.
Sakamoto is their cat. Who is more of a guy that just likes to take it easy and not to be bothered and acts cool.
Outover these are more characters. like Misato Tachibana, whenever she does something it involves real guns in a very funny way.
Enjoyment: 6 Fair.
I mean, When i watch it, the comedy gives me laughs, sometimes giggles sometimes i just literally LOL. But for me, I must have a story or I don't feel like watching it. I'm certain that many would enjoy this to 9-10 if you don't mind a poor story but superb comedy.
Overall: 6 Fair
If I where you, don't just go after the ratings. I think everyone would agree mostly on the Art, Sound and Character. Perhaps Story, but Enjoyment is all personal and what you like.
If you like Slice of Life, and especially Comedy, watch this. If you are one that needs a story to be satisfied and not bored, I would not recommend this one.
Nichijou excels GREATLY at Comedy, but lacks greatly in story. It's somewhat like Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei if you have seen it.
The Art and Sound literally is amazing. Even that immature art is not really my thing. And by that I mean, these are High School students that don't even show a hint of breasts, not even teachers or grandmas. One female teacher here could really be mistaken for a High School Student.",Positif
"Within the Slice-of-Life genre, it’s no surprise to see a cast of characters doing mundane things, going about their ‘ordinary’ daily lives while trying their best to be cute at it. Now what if we took the exact same formula but pulled the ‘ordinary’ right out of it, leaving not even a speck of it behind and blended the remains with some of the most ridiculous ideas and scenarios that one could think of. The result wouldn’t be too far from the Anime known as ‘Nichijou’.
===Story===
This aspect is a bit difficult to consider when it comes to Nichijou, because the show doesn’t really follow any
kind of plot line. There are some developments made here and there that stick throughout the show and are referenced later on, but it’s nothing major enough to be considered as an actual plot line. So then, does that make it a bad show? Of course not! Simply put, Nichijou offers the setting of a certain town and presents a number of different scenarios within each episode that center around a few different groups of characters. As for the nature of these scenarios… They’re seemingly things that you’d face in everyday life but presented and progressed in some of the most humorous and random ways possible. In that way, the jokes remain relatable but still have their own touch of creativity to them.
The nature of the show makes it incredibly easy to watch it whenever. There’s no story to follow so it doesn’t matter if you take your time with it or choose to watch it alongside other shows even, yet it still retains that sense of enjoyment and puts you in a mood that only persuades you further to click for the next episode. So whether it be occasional or binge watching, the experience remains fun either way.
===Art and Animation===
It’s no surprise that being a title produced by Kyoto Animation, the visuals are top notch. But when I say top notch, that doesn’t exactly mean the art is of the most detailed or realistic kind. On the contrary, Nichijou offers a rather plain and simple looking art style that is quite different from what you’d see in KyoAni’s other works, but it fits really well towards Nichijou’s comic-y style and compliments its theme to a great extent.
The Animation is amazingly fluid as well. And especially when it comes to some of the more exaggerated moments, the high quality animation just add to the humor and overall enjoyment of the show.
There’s also some nice attention to detail, namely towards the characters movements and reactions. The way these characters react and behave, such as the changing of their facial expressions might alone be enough to score a laugh.
===Sound===
The soundtrack is presented such that it always seems to fit the mood of the show at the moment. Being a comedy slice-of-life, the score consists mostly of pleasant and up beat music which always seems to lighten the atmosphere. But what is far more impressive than the soundtrack is the voice acting. The seiyuus did an excellent job voicing these characters as some of the best moments came out of the way some of the character’s dialogues are carried out and by simply adjusting to the way a joke is delivered through these character’s voices adds much value to the comedy.
I also feel the need to mention that the Opening sequence, the first one in particular probably has one of the catchiest opening songs I’ve heard. It matches with the nature of the show almost perfectly. Really puts you in the mood and stands as an excellent way to start a new episode.
===Characters===
A comedy is never complete without a cast of fun characters, and thankfully, Nichijou has it covered. The characters are truly some of the most fun and lovable out there. While they appear silly and absolutely ridiculous during most scenes, they still manage to retain their cute personas that you’d normally see in a slice-of-life. I’d describe some of these characters as simply adorable, going about their shenanigans presenting their own selves well through their many actions.
There is one thing I would point out and that is these characters should not be expected to show any major development. Go in fully knowing that these characters have their set personalities and in their own ways, offer to the entertainment of the viewer and the presentation of the show. They are in no way deep and should be enjoyed and taken as they are presented towards the theme of the show.
===Presentation===
And here is where Nichijou manages to excel the most. Even though it consists of practically no plot and a pretty ordinary setting, the way it’s all presented is what really makes it an enjoyable watch. One of the things I loved about this show was how it makes use of some of the most innocent humor and still manages to entertain, and it’s all due to proper execution. Even the little visual effects and animating techniques add so much flavor to it. The show presents a great sense of humor that almost anyone can understand and enjoy. It’s not something that only a small demographic could hope to comprehend. It works for practically anyone.
Also, one cannot help but notice how creative everything is. The way an ordinary situation transitions into something you could have never expected is very well done. And it’s not just a scene developing into whatever the hell came to the writer’s mind, it’s something that relates to the joke and makes it all that entertaining in the first place.
Now I did say that the humor works for practically anyone, but in the end it still does come down to personal tastes. The show does present a few scenarios that some viewers might find to be a bit over the top or just bland as a whole. Thankfully, to my experience though, such moments were very scarce and for the most part they barely ever effected the overall enjoyment I felt towards even a single episode, let alone the whole show.
===Conclusion and Verdict===
Nichijou is an excellent example of how you don’t always need a ground breaking story or a complex plot in order to truly produce a great show. With proper execution and the ability to capture the hearts of its viewers, it is quite possible to score a high spot despite having those shortcomings. If you’re looking for a great time and some pure entertainment then give Nichijou a shot, and I can almost guarantee that you’ll come back with a smile.",Positif
"Look, let me say this out loud....  Ah, screw it.  WATCH THIS NOW!!!  Its KyoAni, very few times they put out garbage.  This isn't garbage one bit.  The art is refreshing compared to what I have been seeing lately.  The story is about a school's life and what surrounds each and everybody that you see.  Different characters, with different stories, and with different lives.  The sound is great whether its the happy go lucky beats of the opening by Hyadain (Kenichi Maeyamada) to the sweet sounds of Sayaka Sasaki and other ending songs sang by the cast.
Speaking of that, the cast is great and when you look at the list, you'll be amazed at who all in it.  It's kinda like a who's who of current and past anime.  As one other reviewer said, Nichijou is fucking AWESOME.  Oh, yeah it is.",Positif
"Every once in awhile, an anime comes around and grabs you by the balls and says “watch me you pleb!” Against your better judgment, you listen to those instinctual feelings and binge-watch the hell out of it.  Nichijou was the recent series that had the effect on me.  I heard about it while perusing the interwebs at funny anime scenes and came across the one with the principal versus the deer.  After visually consuming this gem of a comedy scene, I was almost instantly on Amazon trying to find a copy of the series to purchase.  Nichijou, translated to My Ordinary
Life is truly anything but ordinary.  This anime is an intricately articulated masterpiece of slapstick comedy.  It is art in it's truest form.  I found myself laughing my ass off through every episode at least once, and also taken back at times due to the true genius of the writing.  Nichijou is an exaggeratory wonder with great art, sound and a magnificent script and is severely underrated by many in the anime community.
Nichijou was adapted from a popular manga written by Keiichi Arawi, and debuted on air in 2011 commandeered by famous anime director, Tatsuya Ishihara.  I mean, this guy's done lots of cool stuff like Kanon, Clannad, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and the currently airing Myriad Colors Phantom World.  So undoubtedly, Nichijou's got some expectations to live up to.  Naturally, Ishihara delivers and presents us with 26 episodes of mind melting awesomeness.
It would actually be kind of unfair to officially grade the story of Nichijou.  There really isn't one when you look at it literally.  So, I'll instead focus on the writing.  This anime follows the every day escapades a handful of people go through.  Whether we're talking about the ever-entertaining school girl trio of Yuko, Mai and Mio or the role-reversed professor and robot and their talking cat Mr. Sakamoto, all the characters make seemingly uninteresting daily tasks watchable by anyone with an attention span, and believe me... mine is short.  There are also a few reoccurring scenes within Nichijou I found highly entertaining like the jumproping egg head dudes or the random rock paper scissors games the professor and her robot creation would partake in, always rigged by the professor of course.  There are a couple more of these types of scenes in the anime, and the sequencing throughout each episode ensures even the squirrliest of us can continue to pay attention.  That's perhaps my biggest compliment of the entire show.  Nichijou makes use of “dead time” so well, even if it's with a deadened scene like the ones in Family Guy.
Anyway, I could literally sit here all day and talk about the high quality of writing in the show, but I guess you just have to go and watch it to understand what I mean.  Nichijou is not an anime you need to necessarily watch in order either, so if you're short on time, check out episode 6 first (it's the one with the principal versus the deer) if you want to sample the show.  That shit is pure epicness.  It's rare to find an anime that does what Nichijou does so well... whatever the hell that is.
There are certainly a lot of characters in Nichijou, and although there are some cliché tropes that exist, they're entirely purposeful and only go on to add to the overall humor of the show.  I mean, this anime doesn't even need a story or in depth character development to shine.  Put loads of expressive and over the top characters together in one series and watch hilarity ensue.  Schoolgirls Mai, Mio and Yuko play off each other so well it actually made me step back and go, “Yeah.  THAT is how true comedy is written.” Yuko is the standard goofy girl who often copies her friend's homework because of one reason or another and is highly competitive, even though she's not good at much and hates being insulted.  Mio is the cute, brainy blue-haired one with the crush on the popular guy at school and has a secret manga-drawing addiction.  Lastly, we have Mai: A soft-spoken, overly-sarcastic girl who seems to beat Yuko at every possible thing ever.  She's really as deadpan as you can get.  Other students of note at the school consist of  Kojiro, a sophisticated classic man who often rides a goat to school, followed by his butler.  (Is someone going to remind him that his parents are farmers??) as well as Misato, the tsundere trope that follows Kojiro around hiding her true feelings and often fires random pieces of artillery at him when he pisses her off (like where the hell does she pull this stuff from?).
There are even more characters including a naturally mohawked myth-debunker, a timid teacher with the courage of a 12 year old with stage fright and a talented wrestler that doubles as a principal.  Oh, and I didn't even begin to mention the 8 year old professor and her mom-like robot creation.  And, even with the large amount of characters, I feel the show balanced between them all quite well.  Just when I was beginning to think about why I hadn't seen a character, a knee-slapping scene would come out of the woodwork.  The writers even do a great job incorporating the Professor and Nano (the robot) into the rest of the character's lives.  I was wondering at first, “where the hell do they fit in?”  There's really a character for everyone in Nichijou.  While character development is lacking for obvious reasons, the golden writing and dialogue proves it unnecessary.
The art style in Nichijou is atypical, and definitely does a great job of showing us that you don't need the same stereotypical character design in every show.  The manga is actually very interestingly drawn as well, so Ishihara had some good source material to work with.  Some scenes are drawn sloppily and others take on a super exaggerated feel to express the intensity of the transpiring scenario.  I also absolutely loved the zombified faces some of the characters exhibited throughout the series when they expressed certain emotions.  Again, episode 6 was one of the funniest anime episodes I have ever seen period.  The opening is epic and lively, and I love the stuttered lines uttered by the two singers.  The upbeat and irregular style exuded are refreshing with all the Jpop OPs we're used to seeing these days.  The ending was nothing special, but it added a nice bow on each episode's conclusion.  The rest of the music was catchy and sophisticated, though none of the tracks particularly dazzled me.  The voice acting was top notch though, with notable performances being Mariko Honda as Yuko and Yoshihisa Kawahara as Kojiro.  All in all, the art and sound were great, but not the best ever.
I enjoyed Nichijou almost as much as someone can enjoy a comedic anime.  I can't remember the last time I laughed this much during a series.  I couldn't get enough of the anime, and I fanboyishly talked about it at work to seemingly uninterested individuals.... but it was just that good.  I would recommend Nichijou to anyone who needs a change of pace in their anime backlog or someone who needs a good laugh.  Don't take this show seriously, because it certainly doesn't take itself seriously.",Positif
"I imagine a lot of people wrote Nichijou off as yet another attempt to cash in on the moe craze. With other KyoAni productions (namely K-ON!), it often seems like all of the budget was blown on animation, with the story being of secondary concern. Nichijou does have the same ""slice of life"" style of storytelling used in K-ON! and Lucky Star, but unlike those shows, Nichijou is never overtly pandering to the otaku crowd in an attempt to move more merchandise.
The first handful of episodes led me to believe that Nichijou was going to be the style of ""comedy"" wherein the audience is
expected to laugh at cute girls doing cute things. This concept in no way equates to comedy, it can be entertaining in its own way, but I wish people would stop labeling it comedy. Anyway, once the show introduces its primary characters, things really start to take off. The best parts of the show occur whenever Yukko, Mio, and Mai appear together. Each segment they appear in begins with some simple catalyst that escalates further and further until the character's reactions are no longer appropriate for the situation. Dumb, little incidents often end with shounen style shouting, fighting, running, laser shooting, etc. etc. and its hilarious every time.  Near the end of the series, more attention is paid to secondary characters like Haruna, the girl with the ribbon who's catchphrase ""Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh?"" always made me laugh. While not at the forefront of the story, romance plays a big part in Nichijou as well, with the two equally awkward teachers Sakurai-sensei and Takasaki-sensei always failing to get together and polar opposite students Sasahara, the rich kid, and tachibana, tsundere gun enthusiast, denying their feelings for each other. Before I move on, I should also mention Hakase, Nano, and Sakamoto. If anything, I guess these three are supposed to be our main characters, but their segments are never really as funny as the ones including Yukko, Mio, and Mai, and not as interesting as any of the number of random skits that develop the personalities of the various secondary characters.
As far as the art goes, the show has excellent animation like everything else produced by KyoAni, but the character designs are quite a bit more simple than anything seen in Haruhi, or even Lucky Star. This works in the show's favor since the focus is more on situational comedy than the idealized physical traits used to create moe characters. Because this is a slice of life/situational comedy, the characters usually are just sitting around talking, but when the hyperactive shounen aesthetics overtake the slice of life storytelling, that's when the animation team gets to really shine.
Really, the reason to watch this show is the format. Each main segment is very brief, usually something around five minutes, so if you don't like that particular segment, just hold out and a new one will be on shortly. Some of the best scenes in the show are the short, random segments (Things We Think are Cool, Love-like, Helvetica Standard, etc) that are interspersed between the ones that advance the overall story; although, Mio's dream sequences about the wooden cubes were way too long and did nothing for me personally.
Who knows if future generations of anime fans will still be inundated with what is considered moe to today's audience; maybe K-ON! will seem quaint in the future, much like Love Hina or Tenchi Muyo nowadays (and how many recent fans even know what those shows are, anyway?). As much as it may seem like I'm picking on K-On and/or its fans, I actually enjoyed watching it myself. The point I'm trying to make is that more anime should focus on great characters and storytelling rather than current trends and fads to sell their appeal. If a new anime fan starts watching Nichijou 10 years from now, it'll be because of the comedy and the memorable characters, not because it followed a trend, and that's what the industry should really be aiming for.",Positif
"Nichijou is a prime example of how success isn't a sign of quality. Nichijou did awful in BD and DVD sales in Japan, not even being able to sell a thousand copies in the first week of sales but, this is one of the most funny, charming and consistently entertaining shows I've ever seen and I know I'm not alone on this. Imagine that you take the randomness and wacky characters of FLCL and mix it with the style and sense of humor of Azumanga Daioh. The outcome is a lot better then you'd be able to imagine. Before you write off what I'm saying
as just hype, let me explain.
Story
As the title implies, the story follows the ordinary lives of some high school students. The catch is that these aren't ordinary high school students.  It's just a bunch of lovable goofballs getting into wacky misadventures. There's really nothing else to it. No character development, no drama, no symbolism or even sense of progression and the show is so much better off because of it. Its simple and humor focused plot makes the show just that much better
Art
Just like with the plot, the show carries a very simple art style. Character and environment designs are clean cut and never too complicated. The style also changes to fit the situation on a regular basis in order to reinforce the comedy of the situation. It's something you see all the time in other anime, especially in series that are animated by Bones, but it's done incredibly well here. The animation becomes more complicated and energetic when the show gets into the hyper active style of humor and it becomes more and more simpler and slow when it gets into the slower type of humor. It ranges from highly detailed to bare bones simple and often even mixes the two but it never crosses the line and becomes bad.
Sound
While the voice acting is remarkable and the actors do an amazing job with a wide range of emotions, the same can't be said for the ost. The music in the show isn't very memorable or interesting. It compliments the mood well enough but it's not something you're going to listen to outside of the show itself. I honestly can't think of a single track while writing this review. It's not bad by any stretch of the imagination, it's just kind of unremarkable. This isn't the case for the opening themes. They're both hyperactive and varied perfectly reflecting the show. Go watch the first opening and you'll know exactly what you're getting into. The voice acting is exceptional. There is no dub but even in Japanese, anyone can recognize the great voice acting. The voice actors portray the characters perfectly. They frequently over act but it just works with the show.
Character
As I already said, the show follows the lives of some high school students. There's also an incredibly advanced robot that's indistinguishable from human (besides the key on her back), an eight world scientist who reached the singularity to create this robot and a talking cat. The characters are just a bunch of idiots that do nothing more but get into funny situations. There's not a single one of them that won't put a huge shit eating grin on your face at least once.
Enjoyment
As you can probably tell, I enjoyed this show immensely. It's essentially the Japanese equivalence to Spongebob due to it's hyperactive nature. It breaks my heart to know that there will never be a second season to this show because of its poor sales but hey, that gives more incentive to enjoy what we do have.

"Bias Review #001
What is life? One could describe it as a series of events that we take for granted. Nichijou (My Ordinary Life) displays just that. It shows the everyday things in life we take for granted and some of the first-world problems we have everyday, but in a overdramatized, comedic fashion. This anime has all the characteristics of a slice of life anime and a comedy. Sorry, I just woke up, too, so please excuse the blandness and errors of the review.
Story - 9/10
Nichijou's story is an interesting one because of the fact it has no linear story. Each episode will showcase one
or two events in a characters day. This makes for comedy gold due to some of the hilarious situations a character can get into, such as doodling a private picture in a notebook that   they forgot to erase, and then letting a friend borrow it.
Art - 10/10
The art style of Nichijou is unique, and can't be described with any other word than awesome. The way things are illustrated makes the events that more dramatic.
Sound - 8/10
The Nichijou OST isn't the best, but it is good. Most likely, you won't hear a song that you'd download on your iPod and listen to (this excludes the OP and ED). The show has 2 kickass OPs, and the EDs are lighthearted and sound nice.
Characters - 10/10
Shit, I don't know why, but this is the one part of the review I'm seeming to struggle with. I'm finding it hard to conjure up the right words to describe the characters of Nichjjou because they are so damn unique. I'm sure many would disagree with me on that, but the fact that the characters can be so average seeming at one point, and then hyper as fuck is what makes it unique.
Overall - tenouttaten
Nichijou is a great anime and I definitely recommend it. It's one of my favorites (wow so bias) and it will most certainly be forever. If you have any criticism please tell me on my profile! Thanks!",Positif
"Nichijou was a really special show for me and I hold it very dear to my heart. I felt that it had an extra layer to it that people might easily overlook, and I hope that by reading this you will see what I saw too. I'm going to write this as if you've watched the whole series because there isn't really much plot to spoil for you.
Story 10/10
I can understand why people can overlook the plot, but I found that it was really subtle, appropriate and really beautiful. What I saw were basically two arcs: the first is before Nano goes to school
and the second is after she goes to school. If you put those together, you pretty much get the plot of the entire series.....Nano goes to school. It was the details and the build up that made me love the plot so much. Nano is a robot (is that a spoiler?) so she is kept around the house to do chores. At the same time she lacked the confidence to try to fit in with other children (she's 2 years old apparently) because of the key on her back and was afraid that she will be excluded for being a robot. Short scenes throughout the first arc were explicitly placed here and there that show that Nano really wanted to go to school, but it wasn't really emphasized until around midway through the season when Sakamoto-San mentions it out loud. I picked up on these hints over the course of many episodes by reading Nano's body language, so when she finally went to school it was kind of emotional for me. It made me think about what a blessing it is to be able to go to school with other kids your age.
My final point to add concerning the plot was an interesting quotation that Sasahara slipped in near the end of the season. He said something like ""everyday life is a miracle"" (that's the name of the show!), and after seeing how happy Nano was going to school and making friends, that sentence hit me like a train. These kind of hard hitting quotes kind of pop up here and there throughout the series and they are all relevant to the theme of everyday life.
I was really surprised by these couple details that swung the mood around, and I hope that everyone who watches this series will be able to see them and appreciate them as well.
Art 10/10
Though the art was very simple, the quality was just really good. I guess you could compare it to drawing stick figures in high definition. There are a lot of interesting background details in a lot of the scenes too, and the animation for certain scenes were just hilariously good. Well done KyoAni.
Sound 10/10
The opening theme songs were so amazingly hyper and the ending themes were sweet. Perfect for getting up in the morning and laying down in bed at night (kind of like a routine day! hmmm....). One of the reasons I like to watch subbed anime more than dubbed is because Japanese voice actors are pretty amazing. I think one thing that was kind of notable in Nichijou was the screaming, which they pull off very well and adds to the absurdly outrageous humor of the show.
Character 10/10
The characters were some of the most attractive aspects of Nichijou, so if you found that you didn't really like them you will probably not enjoy it so much.
I already wrote a little bit about my favourite character Nano. She's really cute when she sees cockroaches and the last few moments of the last episode were unexpectedly emotional because of her key.
I really liked how three of the main characters were designed as three very distinctly different people, but still somehow got along as best friends. Yukko and Mai never understood each other at all but they are still able to make up with each other and play games together (without knowing the rules; were there even rules?). From watching the way they interact with each other I often questioned whether they were actually friends, but it was adorable how every time Yukko would just shrug it off and continue.
There was and interesting bit of character development when Mio was ""crushed"" by her crush (hahaha dkm). After finally calming down she says something like ""life is like baseball: you just never know what's going to happen"". It's kind of random how she compares it to baseball, but at the same time I found that to be really relatable and I think about that quotation pretty often in my life.
Another special moment for me was some half episode near the end of the series where Mio's friends put together a gift for her. What they gave her totally sumo-slammed my heart because it came completely unexpected from the fun, somewhat shallow relationships we see in most of the series.
Enjoyment 10/10
Nichijou is the kind of show that caters to a pretty specific type of humor, and if you weren't charmed by the characters you probably will not enjoy it. Each half episode either features some outrageous random episode, or progresses the pretty mundane everyday life of the characters. I found that I enjoyed it the entire time I was watching it, and was suddenly amazed by the unexpectedly emotional bits they snuck in.
Overall 10/10
I found that this show was outstanding and I totally did not expect it. It was recommended to me by a close friend who thought I would appreciate the kind of humor it offered, but I ended up seeing a lot more than just that.
I hope that after reading this you will be able to appreciate the intricacy and subtlety that Nichijou snuck in because I think it's often overlooked and consequently underrated.",Positif
"Nichijou, the Eric Andre Show of anime.
Nichijou is what would happened if you choose slice of life type of surrounding and pump the plot, detail and action all FULL HIGH. Seriously, this show looks as if it was a program on Adult Swim, with it's surreal humor and bizarre plots. Going in to this show I didn't really know what to expect, or should I say I should have expected nothing, because watching the first episode just blew everything I had in mind. Already, the first episode just threw me in the world that is Nichijou, many times does the show get me laughing
in all the funny, childish and outright out of this world jokes. Since the first episode, I can't help but be in awe by what it has to present. While the show might seemed as if there is no story and continuation, there actually is! Over the course of the show, many of the episode link and with scenarios connecting other plot lines. The show is extremely detailed, meticulously detailed. It is by far one of the most well taken cared of series I have seen in a long shot. From the super dense and hilarious intro, packed filled with animation smooth as a baby's skin, this, of course, resulted in memes and that's always wonderful to here. All the characters have life, all of them, even the very subtle ones, they move and react with their surroundings. The show also integrates all these small kinds of interlude such as 'love-like' or 'short thoughts' which really provides a kind of breather to all the other fast paced plots of the show. Of course, my favorite of them all has to the one and only 'Helvetica Standard'. There is definitely tons to talk more about but I must admit I am kinda late to the party with this show and there are other reviews that touch on them way better than I do.
-SCORES-
Characters- 10/10: ALL OF THEM ARE SO WELL WRITTEN. From Aioi, Mai and Mio - Professor, Mr Sakamoto and Nano - Ms Sakurai, Mr Takasaki and Makoto - damn even to animals and that weird Kingdom plot, all the characters are fantastic. They all written so well they blend right in to this weird world, not one of them feels out of place. Plus the show makes you wish you had a town like this.
Art- 10/10: Geez man, the art in this is a masterpiece. The minimal approach to this makes if the show is simple, but this is quickly contradicted by the plot and occasional super detailed scenes. What I also love is that the show presents us with a somewhat 'loading screen' between scenarios where there are characters interacting within this one frame of a place. That to me is so cool and interesting, like the show draws in the viewers attention by constantly presenting new and refreshing locations. To me the show just seems like a work of art as the details they put easily beats like, 80 to 90 percent of all other animes.
Writing- 9/10: My gosh where do I even begin for this, the writing is really all over the place but in the best way possible. It is packed filled with interesting and outright hilarious comedy that truly one of a kind. Yes there are some head scratchers but this is what the show does best. This may not be seen by some but the show's mysterious plots and the way it makes scenes unexpected is what the show masters at. It constantly draws in it's audience by making them wonder what is going to happen, plus some is really out of the blue and leaves me laughing. The only thing that is making this a 9 in the category is that I just want more, like the last episode didn't really conclude Ms Nakamura ( the science teacher) discovery of Nano or finding Boss (Mr Sakamoto). I know and have read about why there is no season two, such as the Fukushima incidents that occurred during the run time of this show and that in Japan, there weren't a big fan base for this show to continue. Truly that is a let down but what the show has to offer for these 26 episode is seriously something we should be grateful for.
Sound- 10/10: EHHHHHHH??? How can a anime series make the sound so much like real life?!? Nichijou just smashes this category/. One word for the voice actors, 'GOD'. The voice actors behind this show is also what makes this so good, it is so clear to see that the actors really put in such effort to make their script sound so smooth. I applause them for that and they serious did a great job, from all the 'EEYY!!!' to the 'WHAAAAAA!!!!', they really outdone themselves. Plus the intro for the show in both halves are really one of a kind. I love them both and the outro is just a cherry on top of what is already a 24k gold cake. The show even took it so far as to have multiple outros for the second half, that is really something. The OST for this as well is dense, like really well made.
Overall, I love this series so much. This show really goes beyond the boundaries of anime and it really is a staple to anime humor. I know many are wanting more, and believe me in hell would I love more as well. But I rather have 26 super fantastic episodes rather than have more drained and lifeless episodes. I am grateful for that the show has to offer and I would cherish it deeply.
Definitely a Strong 9 on this one.",Positif
"I don't know what to say, I love this anime so much! I mean I've gone as far as makeing my own Hakase Cosplay. I as well have 3 posters from Nichijou as well. I'm just gonna come out in say it's one of my favorite animes. Yea I'm sure there are anime 1000s times funnyer. But for right now this one is my favorite next to One Piece and Haruhi Suzmiya. I've grown into the characters alot as well. I kinda teared up on the final episode as well. But Overall I will say it's my favorite out there and I say to anyone
who has not seen it yet to check it out!",Positif
"This anime is just.....amazing, I have not stopped smiling since I started watching it, have now watched all 26 episodes and have loved every minute of them, each episode contains loads of 'shorts' involving the different characters in hilarious and random events.....from colliding into someone causing a huge explosion or high speed chase to get back a notebook...everything in this anime is so wonderfully detailed and thought out, the art style is cute and oozing character...all the characters show their personalities well and each 'short' has me holding my breath for what is about to happen....this is my first experience with 'slice of life' anime
and can gladly say it has made me want to see more :)",Positif
"Now i don't write reviews because i just don't have the time to do so. But for this show i will make an exception. I give this a 10 for a really good reason, for one the  anime industry seems to be hitting rock bottom with shows like Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi, Qwaiser, Blood C, and No. 6 (example of the worst of 2011 during Nichijou airing). the second reason is it is the vary essence of four panel manga brought to life by the most lovable cast of characters that act as a breath of fresh air in a industry that is
running out of ways of making a new anime  that is deprived of a PLOT. this is obviously a four letter word that is deprived in anime now a days, excluding a handful of gems in summer of 2011, like Usagi drop. Don't get me wrong though, Nichijou takes this to an even greater extreem and erases ""plot"" from the dictionary.
So then what makes Nichijou so good, its that it uses Situation gags and a LOT of characters, each with their own unique personalities. These situations and gags are enough to make a person laugh till tears come out (it happened to me each and every episode). This style is vary unique and reminded me of four panel manga's throughout the show. Hell i can safely say its like the feeling of reading the sunday funnies.
As for other shows that it competes with, well... ***spoiler*** when you are competing with a show that has a robot that has a rocket propelled big toe that is activated by the key on their back... well i think that energy should be used for later works because they will not have a chance.
I give this gem of gems a ten out of ten for giving me a show that is true to its self and its uniqueness.
as a final warning don't watch this when drinking any thing, especially milk",Positif
"Nichijou looks like your typical moe schoolgirl anime archetype but pretty quickly you come to realise that's completely wrong. Nichijou is more like an acid trip. It's totally random, bizzarre and most importantly - hilarious. If you're looking for a new Lucky Star then you're sadly mistaken, it's more along the lines of the classic Azumanga Diaoh if you ask me - and only when Osaka is having weird dreams about the Chiyo's Dad, the cat-thing.
While some of the humour might not be understood because it's a really obscure Japanese thing, or it's just too downright weird to be that funny (one of the episodes
has a weird extended sequence involving these imaginary characters and two wooden blocks, I don't remember too much because it wasn't that funny).
The characters are brilliant, my personal favourites are Mai, Hakase, Nano & Sakamoto. Shout out to Sekiguchi Yuria who is the 'Eeeh?' girl :)
Overall, it's a really fun anime which might surprise you in how atypical it is.",Positif
"“Murphy’s law” and “random shit” are the two words that perfectly describe Nichijou. This is one anime that anyone and everyone can enjoy (Hell, I watched it with my 8 year old sister).
Story ( --/10) -
If you are looking for any semblance of a story in Nichijou, I advise you to look elsewhere.
However, this should not be taken as a flaw as it saves us the trouble of remembering extraneous things and instead helps us concentrate on the humour and humour alone.
In this regard, you can favourably compare it to Mr. Bean as both shows have: no story, episodic format, copious amounts of random
shit and are ideal representations of Murphy’s law (anything and everything goes wrong).
Character – (11/10)
According to me, this show has the wackiest set of characters that I have ever witnessed in any form of entertainment (and that list is long). The characters are diverse, have their own unique quirks and idiosyncrasies and every one of them is pretty damn funny.
Some especially hilarious characters are: The rich, haiku spouting kid who comes to school on a goat (because chauffeur driven Roll’s Royces are so mainstream), the Tsundere who pulls out a bazooka if you even talk about her crush and the Oh So Kawaii! pint- sized professor who exasperates her talking cat and her robotic friend cum maid cum cookie dispenser cum android dreaming to be an ordinary schoolgirl, with her childish antics (after all the Professor is 8 years old).
That said, I loved all the characters and this anime wouldn’t have been what it was if it hadn’t been for them.
Art (10/10)-
The artwork in Nichijou is spectacular. The backgrounds are eye wateringly beautiful and the characters are cute, well drawn and fun to watch.
I also liked the fact that comedic scenes had special artwork (example- Yukko’s beserk button) which made them all the more funnier. All in all, an amazing job.
Sound (9/10)-
The opening and ending themes were vibrant and upbeat. The voice actors did their job consummately and the background music was well done.
Final rating (9.5/10)-
Overall, I loved this anime, its wacky characters and almost everything else about this show. I also think that the rewatch value of this show is high and I definitely look forward to watching it again, if possible.
So, just grab a beer, hit the couch and enjoy the misadventures of the cast. You won’t regret it (you might get a hangover though. Just saying).",Positif
"(9.0/10)
______________________________________________________________
Nostalgia is a powerful thing. You can look back at the past with rose-tinted glasses and see a world that felt brighter and happier than it may have been. A world that sparkles, cascading happiness, rather than limping along like a wounded animal.
This wistful affection for the past is what makes the now so hopeful, in a way, because you know you can look back at it for years to come and perhaps remember something differently. Whether it's good or bad, you look back knowing more, being smarter, and understanding the situations and why you were in them.
This feeling permeates throughout Nichijou;
a plucky, goofy show that has a thumping heart full of joy, a heart full of living in the now, a heart that it wears on its sleeve. It's a beautiful series, really, one that started off as a funny look into the lives of three girls who became friends due to circumstance. As well as their detours and the characters that happen to encapsulate the screen at the time.
The series, however, sprouted into something else. It became a nostalgic trip of relate-able situations and inspiring commentary interspersed with scenic shots of everyday life. It's amazing.
______________________________________________________________
[STORY / CHARACTERS]
Throughout the show you are introduced to various, equally adorable characters that exist in this unique universe. Each one harboring enough quirks to plug a wine cellar.
The shows structure serves these characters, too. For the first thirteen episodes, Nichijou's structure is incredibly loose or flat-out non-existent. There really isn't much tying any scene together, and that's what initially caught my attention. This show was virtually skit after skit. What actually surprised me, however, was just how funny it is. The idea of blowing up an everyday occurrence (forgetting homework, for example) to this big, insane situation isn't an original idea, however, what the show does have going for it is Kyoto Animation's animation.
While this show's comedic styling is reminiscent of most anime comedy, which I dislike, in the sense that it's very ""reactionary"", as I call it. Where the punchline, usually, is a character's reaction to a situation. The show does do well with creating some more unique setups, but it also shines with, as I said, the animation.
KyoAni pretty much nailed it here. The show is really pretty to look at. The director's deft shot composition plus the various changes in style that a certain scene may go through shows a great understanding of comedic visuals. Fairly often, the show would completely change style to delivery a scene better. Whether it's washing out the colors, going for hyper-realism, or going for flat-out surrealism. It almost always created an interesting scene to look at. This style segmented with skits of hyper action animation have the show skirt the line between exhilaration and intensity.
...
KyoAni's animation isn't the only thing that shines though. The Characters, and in turn, their VA's, are some of the best I've ever heard in anime. Specifically, the jaw-droppingly adorable professor Hakase, whom was voice acted by Konno Hiromi, was a pleasure to watch (and hear). The character herself was great, mainly because she was one of the most realistic, yet equally unrealistic kid-characters I've seen in quite a while.
She's a genius engineer that also acts like a little kid. By acts like a little kid I don't mean ""is"" a little kid, while obviously she is. Many shows often skirt their kid characters into two groups. Obnoxious annoyance and adorable cuteness. There really isn't a mix, because honestly, that's what a real kid is like; a mix. Hakase has her moments of utter obnoxiousness but those are floating in a stew of delightfully cute character moments that are very reminiscent of an actual kid, rather than what a writer might think a kid would act like. Hakase is separate from the main cast of three girls though. She generally inhabits her laboratory/house with her robot caretaker Nano and talking cat, Sakamoto. This keeps the structure loose and the situations constantly varied.
The second standout is Yuuko, voiced by Honda Mariko, who absolutely blew me away. Her comedic voice work is spectacular. Her voice, like, the actual sound of her voice is perfect for comedy. The amount of times Yuuko's entire cadence,pitch,tone changes is a marvel to listen to. Her voice is amazing for her role as the forgetful, ditsy, yet oddly passionate Yuuko.
That being said, every character really gets his or her time to shine. With a cast of really rich and vibrant secondaries that honestly have some of the shows best moments. KyoAni's animation and style is also to blame for this shows likableness. The character designs and general aesthetic is so enjoyable to look at. Each character is very malleable and just looks great for the role that they were given.
...
This show does have a transition midway through its run. It's not major, but it made me go from very much enjoying it to falling in love with it. Hitting the midway point, the theme-song changes from something that's kind of random and goofy (with lyrics about love) to something a bit more... emotionally resonant and thematic? Although it's still equally endearing and fun, much like the show, it actually fits the show's motif now too.
Lyrics about friendship, being there when your friend is down, showing them that they aren't alone are all included in this new intro. These themes are prevalent throughout the show, especially the second half, where a character that was pretty separate in terms of skits from the three main girls decides to go to their school.
This is where friendships begin to form and a whole new, surprisingly subtle, commentary about imperfections and acceptance are made. The structure is tightened ever so slightly so now episodes are more focused on an overarching, yet very slight narrative.
Talking about the narrative, it's surprisingly well crafted for a show that really didn't need to have it well crafted. The narrative structure is more reminiscent to the Monogatari series rather than something like Toradora. This fractured narrative is actually quite interesting, as some scenes in episodes feel disorganized but come together towards the end.
These rapid-fire comedy scenes with a small narrative are split by these beautiful scenic shots of life. Whether it's the train-tracks or just an elevator, Nichijou cuts to these scenes maybe three or four times per episode, showing you what everyday people are up to. It's kind of beautiful and understated.
This understated nature continues with some of the shows delivery of skits. Every episode continues a few running gags from previous installments and has these comic-like shorts within the episode. These shorts are usually, well... short, but generally very quiet and cute as well.
...
While the comedy in the show is almost always relate-able, some of it does get lost in translation; literally. A lot of the shows humor is very cultural, which is fine, but it makes some of the puns very tough to understand. I had to do some external research if I wanted to understand everything in the show.
That's not a bad thing, however, it does impede enjoyment when i'm left high and dry on a joke due to it being strictly cultural. But even these cultural jokes make sense in context, with you understanding the connotation for the most part.
This is what makes Nichijou such a joy to watch as a show. I found myself remembering back to similar situations, which may have occurred different culturally, but had similar effects. For example, going into a test and being presented with a problem on it that has art associated with it. This art is fucking confusing and you're left pondering what the art may be rather than the actual problem. This connected with just how fast time seems to fly when you are taking a test makes for some hilarious commentary and nostalgia-filled views on high-school life.
______________________________________________________________
[SOUND]
As I've mentioned, the show has a pretty enjoyable soundtrack with some strong musical stings. Much like a lot of anime, these stings are repeated constantly and if you don't grow to like them then they'll soon begin to annoy the ever living fuck out of you.
Thankfully the stings in Nichijou are appealing to me. The music in the show helps tell it's many stories. The lively experiences that exude a memorable quality about them.
Both openings are actually not too bad, and I usually hate Jpop anime openings. Specifically the second one is downright addicting and really captures the shows vibe. I found myself actually watching the openings, which I usually skip in most other shows.
______________________________________________________________
[STORY / CHARACTERS] - Part 2
If you can't tell, there's a lot to talk about when it comes to the shows themes and storytelling. A lot of the joy these girls (and boys) experience in their day-to-day life goes from being cute, charming, and funny to being downright inspirational. A simple skit on pole-vaulting turns into something that's over-the-top and crazy, but also something that's undoubtedly full of heart. You buy into this world, and that's what makes it so special.
Nichijou also has some very strong comedic pauses, as they try to let certain jokes breath which is honestly a breath of fresh air. It is also mandatory for a series like this to do it because often times the jokes do run long, and if you don't like the joke you'll find yourself really zoning out. These thankful pauses create some of the shows most memorable and fun sequences.
With KyoAni shining brightly with the animation, most of the shows most incredible (and rewatchable) sequences are also the ones that have an immense amount of sakuga, or moments where the animation improves drastically and becomes something incredible.
...
As I've said, themes of togetherness and friendship ring close to home for me. This show encapsulates that and delivers some incredibly sappy, yet also  stunningly heartwarming sequences that, I won't lie, definitely got me emotional... and i'm strictly a non-emotion having watcher of just about any show.
Nichijou is very honest with it's emotions too, it wears them on it's sleeve. It smartly avoids melodrama for most of it's run-time, which means that just about every aspect of this show is devoid of the every day boring drama that you'd watch a romcom for. So when it does deliver some melodrama towards the end, it's easier to buy and swallow.
The romantic elements are also mostly played for laughs, which is a welcome break from ""we have to pair these characters together!"" Certain characters which pine over the same person never really meet or discuss and no boring love-triangle is formed. It's the little choices this show makes to become extra-love able in my eyes.
______________________________________________________________
[CONCLUSION]
Nichijou is damn near perfect. It loves life, and it makes you love life too. It's a show about friendship and togetherness in an incredibly cute style with some standout animation and direction from the Kyoto Animation team. When the show does get sappy, it's the kind of sappy that you buy because at that point you love these characters and love seeing them interact and live on screen.
It breaths life. The scenic shots of the city, the homey comic skits, the over-the-top reactions to certain situations. This show is not only funny, it's smart in it's delivery and setting. It truly is something special. Nichijou is about friends. It's about imperfections. It's about being together. There's nothing that surprised me more than this. I didn't expect to watch a show fitting the holidays so much. I'm eager to watch it again.
As I wrapped up my viewing at four AM last night, I sat up in my bed and wiped whatever was struggling to come out of my eye. I thought about my experience with this show and what I feel like I got out of it. I opened my eyes the next day and life was just a little more interesting.",Positif
"Nichijou is by far my favorite comedy anime out there. Sometimes i just wish there were more episodes.
Nichijou is mostly so funny because its just surreal and weird, like when Nano tripped and caused an nuclear explosion, or when something annoying happens they just look at each other like ( ͡°ʖ ͡°).
It's the surrealism that makes this anime so great. Normal comedy anime don't do major jokes like once destroying the whole neighborhood for a joke, that's what makes it so great.
This anime was boring for me at first but after a while i started enjoying it and was laughing my ass
off sometimes. If you want to cheer up then this anime is perfect for you. 8/10, very good.",Positif
"If I had to sum up Nichijou in one word, that would be an easy choice: overrated.
I didn't dislike this series at all, but its comedy was remarkably inconsistent. It felt like for every joke that landed perfectly, there was one right after it that didn't land at all. Sometimes the pacing is perfect, sometimes the pacing is garbage. I remember before I started watching this show, people told me this was way better than other slice-of-life series like Lucky Star, but I just don't get that same level of enjoyment out of it.
I think my issue is that I'm a much bigger fan of
the slow burn style of comedy, when the joke is built up over time with a reasonable payoff at the end. Nichijou feels like the writers got together, wrote down random punchlines on cocktail napkins and threw them all into the show. The animation is certainly better and more expressive than that of other slice-of-life shows, but that doesn't make it a better overall product. Whereas a stellar slice-of-life show builds its characters up and makes us want to spend more time with them, Nichijou has absolutely zero focus. For every sketch centered around one of the main four, there's THREE featuring characters I couldn't care less about. The overall structure could have been much better. Nichijou also puts a lot more effort into making certain characters outwardly obnoxious and difficult to like. My prime examples for this are Hakase and the Daifuku Man, I cannot stand either of these characters. Other side characters, such as Misato, are typically reduced to one running joke that they expect to be funny for 26 full episodes.
The side segments such as Helvetica Standard are about on the same level as the main show itself: very hit-or-miss. The jokes that are more down-to-earth are the ones that tend to stick with me, and it's just unfortunate that Nichijou doesn't have as many of them as I would have liked to see. This show does have very funny moments, and I did get some degree of enjoyment out of watching it, but a significant portion of Nichijou is just bizarre. Sometimes it feels like taking the ASDFMovie series and stretching each sketch out to 3 full minutes. The pacing is also frequently killed by the random 10-second cutaways before we return right back to the sketch before it, what is even the point of these cutaways???
I understand that comedy is subjective, and Nichijou presents a style of humor that I don't always click with, but inconsistency haunts every corner of this series. There are a lot of highlights, but also a lot of duds. And for a show this inconsistent to be in the top 100 highest-rated anime on this site honestly baffles me. I get it if you put a lot of stock in a show's animation, because Nichijou is one of the best in that department, but if you're looking for interesting characters, consistently good humor or anything of that nature, it's hard for me to say that you'd find it here.
With all this being said, I don't think Nichijou is BAD. There are a number of good characters and good sketches within the show, my issues lie in the fact that the good and the bad see a 50/50 split. Sometimes I laughed, sometimes I had no response, and sometimes I just scratched my head wondering what drugs the producers were on before writing and animating a particular sketch. For every genius character like Sakamoto or Takahashi, there's an insufferable character like Hakase or the Daifuku Man. It's an incredibly balanced scale and that's just not what I want from a comedy series.",Positif
"Nichijou my ordinary life, or rather my ordinary life and crazy idea of a Japanese director. The story is divided into 4 parts, Yuuko bow, bow Hakase and Nano, Helvetica Standar bow, Short thoughts bow, all very random, trying to be as normal as possible, it is difficult to understand at first and if you have no idea of Japanese language and context.
The characteristic draw of Kyoto Animation, with bright colors and animation style changes at times.
The soundtrack is not bad, but not something that highlights much as animated exception of openings.
Hakase, Nano and Sakamoto certainly takes all attention on the anime being moe and
still as fun as they are at least more understandable jokes. Yuko and her friends eventually convinced me not but have its funny moments.
Everywhere humor, satire and references to other anime and an final that represents the best of life a beautiful friendship.",Positif
"If there was one word I could use to describe this anime, it would be ""Innovative.""
At first glance(or episode), I saw this show as a lazy knock-off of the ""greats"" of the slice of life genre like Lucky Star, Azumanga, etc.  Upon further examination, I saw little by little and in the details, how amazing this show was, until it became a masterpiece in my mind.
Although anime like Haruhi and Chuunibyou may have the full blast of pure beauty, Nichijou has that same amount of effort poured into creativity.  Many things in this anime have never been animated this way(to my knowledge).
You truly never know what to expect!  Nichijou is exciting because of it's huge cast of characters and locations.  They present so many characters in a pleasing, and not an overwhelming, way.  There's no way to know which way an episode might take you(or a scene for that matter!)
This show has left me on the floor gasping for air, from laughing too much.  The voice acting is incredible(especially Mio and Yuuko).  The art is explosive and entertaining.  The characters are very likeable, and since this is a slice of life comedy, I took the liberty of describing each main character from my own point of view.
OVERVIEW:
This is a slice of life that follows, for the most part, the ""ordinary"" lives of three girls in school.  Mai, Yuuko, and Mio.  Also, there are three other main characters that are slowly introduced.  They are:  The Professor, her android, Nano, and their talking cat, Sakamoto.
CHARACTERS:
This is one of many places where this anime shines!  This isn't your typical anime.  The characters are very well done and are very funny.
MAI-Wears glasses, quiet, very serious most of the time and devious at times.  Has a VERY different sense of humor.  She is that character that always wins no matter what.  She is always prepared while others suffer.  At first, you hate her.  But most people tend to love her in the end.
MIO-Mio is an average girl in terms of grades and social status.  She draws yaoi manga and is always trying to hide it.  She is calm 90% of the time, but when she does get angry, watch out, it's explosive.
YUUKO-Poor Yuuko, lol.  She's no good at studies, and doesn't have a lot of confidence.  She likes to make people laugh.  It seems like the whole world is against her most of the time, but she has a good attitude most of the time.  She always smiles and is happy to be with her friends.
The Professor(Hakase)-The Professor is your dose of cute in this anime.  She apparently has no family, acts like an 8 year old(she is), but can invent just about anything she wants.  She made an android that looks human(Nano) and has a perfect human personality.  She made a scarf that makes their cat talk.  She can be innocently selfish, but she is very loving.  She's a typical little kid.
NANO-Nano is pretty much the favorite character for most people who watch this.  She wants to be like a normal human more than anything.  She has a giant screw in her back that she hates but the professor thinks it's cute and won't let her take it out.  She takes care of the professor and is very loving.  She is also very moe.
SAKAMOTO-Talking cat.  Basically, this character is awesome because it is voiced by Minoru Shiraishi.
If you liked, Lucky Star, Azumanga Daioh, Ika Musume, or Sergeant Frog, this is a must see!",Positif
"This is the best anime of all time. The absolute perfect comedy-tragedy-slice-of-life-drama-action-non-fiction-documentary-romance-anime-manga-omake-historical, it is the pinnacle of entertainment.
Nichijou is about everything. It's about people, it's about school, it's about pets, it's about comedy, it's about culture, it's about philosophy, it's about fiction, it's about manga, it's about romance, it's about ethics, it's about the development of technology, and it's about the world. It's funny, heartwarming, sad, thought-provoking, entertaining, and, quite frankly, one of the best pieces of media I have ever had the joy of watching.
If you like watching things, you will like Nichijou. And, if you decide you don't like Nichijou, then, well...
All I can say is that ""this level of comedy was obviously too high"" for you.",Positif
"So many hidden trivia happen on this show. So many shut-down attempting every detail contributing to this show. Even my country language and its local joking get over on this show, which is really surprising from its beginning. My only complain was the end, tho. I know some kind of SoL doesnt need to get a resolve story. But, in this 26 episodes, i really need something clear and more conclusive. Hell, whatever, i enjoy the joke and its comedy through some of their random scenes, while its last. Parting every characters meet its end with too much compress in the last episodes really sad.
But, a punchline keep its best, until a final blown.
Surprising, with the happy end to Nano, tho. Her inner feeling, toward her scene and monologue, i know. Her behaviour sometimes irked me, but whatever, she still a cute robotic girl. And for the kiddo, and the black cat, nice try, you all so fun til the end. Nice catch. Even with the woman science teacher really nice to see her end with nice conclusion with Nano. They really need time to solve the misinterpretation. And, including the black cat as a bridge really a brilliant idea! I love it, man, really.
Thats all, not much i can say. This is a legend. I may call this as a base reference, or a master SoL joke ever as a main contribution toward some of the other anime SoL. Nichijou really keep its original random-shit, which is really a masterpiece for me. What else? Yuuko, you are the shinny star here. You deserve better life a joker in your future, rather your shitty bacluck ever. Lol. So much fun meet my criteria. There is always some hidden point that i dont get it at all until the end. Alas, i dont care. Much i care was the story, the joke, the comedy. Even its ED and OP OST really smooth. I can't anything rather than always smile whenever i watching this show. Really a legend toward this era. A gold never get old, so it is with this Nichijou.
As i keep my initial review stabile at the end, i may say the second cour be the less bite comparing its first. But, as a story progression, its better than before. Idk what was that, but i suggest its just how great KyoAni preference, to make such a nice flow story to be going on in this show. A great completion, nothing can get it at all. Even when you keep pushing your limit, you cant even stand with this show, never. So like me, with that situation i may come to the conclusion that this show is full of nice attempt.
I can't clear the review with a simple phrase like before. This show was a complex, so i must my complexity at my review as well. It is, then, a great 8 can be my satisfy end to this story telling. Art, a 7 may be enough. Sounds, and music? Fantastic! Even 10 points not be enough to show my gratitude! To the characterization, this is a huge beneficial! Even such an ant, had its characteristic progression as well, what a beast, author of Nichijou! 10 must be enough to silent my curiosity! So after all happen at once, i may suggest this series can be a nice simple 10 at my anime listing. But, i still had a big holes in my chest.
What is the purpose of this show? Thats question still hanging on my mind. Til its clear, i will keep my 9 on this to state what i feel right now. Is it can change? I may be stated yes, but sometime i feel no. Comparing to the another show, this review point keep solid until my dead. So, yeah, unfortunately, despite the amazing moment happen in the Nichijou and its antic situations, 9 shall be my last moment of the truth. Again, as the masterpiece, this show 100% complete as a solid 10 for my list.
But, as my inner heart can not aggree with my logical failure judgement compeling all of the full 26 episodes, the 9 is the last scheme to stop all my misery. My best review at the SoL antics show. The first. My last. Really? I guess no, i love the SoL genre, so why not? 9 still be my best thought. I hope. Okay, then! Time to move on!",Positif
"Nichijou is no doubt one of the best comedies, if not the best comedy to be made in this past decade. It does a really good job taking a slice of life and turning it into something unorthodox. It creates this sort of aesthetic flare with its dynamic art style, which essentially establishes and creates a classic comedic atmosphere. It takes random, and turns it into bizarre and extraordinary. It doesn't only accentuate comedy through what characters say and do, but also with the atmosphere and world itself. It is encapsulated and is ever overflowing with a very inventive world. It intertwines realistic and fiction
making it appear as if they are all the same. It's jokes are very fluid, giving the itself an unpredictable approach every step of the way, which is very much need in comedy. It fuses gag, light satire, moe, and so on in the in one of the best ways done ""ever"". With all these qualities, I am sure you will always find yourself constantly reminiscing back on its highlights which is pretty much the entirety of the show. The show stands out from others with minimal effort and can be easily considered a classic and re-watchable. Thanks to KyoAni, future shows on the comedic road will always have a great and upstanding example of what comedy at it's prime really is.",Positif
"The irony in Nichijou is what makes this anime one of the funniest I have seen, and its greatest irony is that people seem to think that this is a slice of life comedy.
No, my friends, it is not.
It is a poignant and well thought out statement against the over-demanding expectations of the youth to participate in the toxic work culture of modern Japan. Although the art style is cutesy and the humour somewhat silly, this is a poetic tool used by Keeichi Awari to create an obvious contrast between childhood and adulthood in Japan. Nichijou is about losing a sense of indivuality and
steeling oneself so they can fit into the unforgiving uniformity of Japanese culture, complimenting the well known Japanese proverb ""the nail that sticks out gets hammered down"".
Although there are no real ""main characters"" in Nichijou, the main message is portrayed through the interactions of Yuuko Aioi, Mai Minakami and Mio Naganohara. As the series progresses we witness various societal pressures whittle away at their youthful enthusiasm until they are emotionless husks by the end of the series.
Yuuko is the stereotypical student who struggles to find meaning in her academic endeavors and yet is rebuked every time she falls short of the expectations set before her. She is disillusioned and unable to make sense of her life. She is often punished by her teachers for scoring poorly on exams and her friends begin to look down on her with contempt as she continues to struggle. In order to cope with the stress, she resorts to using her humour to make light of certain situations, but this is met with frustration or indifference from her peers. In later episodes, Yuuko's shortcomings culminate into a collective disbelief in her abilities and people begin dictating what she can and cannot do. It gets to the point where Yuuko politely asks if she can order a local delicacy at a convenient store but the vendor rejects her request, stating that she is not the type of person who could enjoy it. This was the last straw, and it sends her into the night sobbing silently into her sleeve. Through Yuuko, the audience is exposed to the gradual demoralization of the Japanese youth which is culturally embedded to prepare its students for the grating lifestyle of servile obedience expected of the average office worker.
Mio, on the other hand, is an overachiever. She is an aspiring mangaka with considerable talent and promising connections to move up in the manga world. But through her, we see what the price of success is in modern Japan. And it requires long, grueling hours of overtime, an uncanny passion for your work and a drive for perfection. But, in compensation, forks over nothing more than a modest sum for your efforts. And it is here that we begin to see the inane bureaucracy of the Japanese workplace. For it is the success of the company, not the individual, that comes first. Mio, is in fact, an advocate of the homosexual community in Japan and wishes to use manga as a platform to promote their wellbeing, however she is barred from drawing manga in this subject matter as it will not sell. She is even shamed for going against the grain and proposing to publish something like that as a novice, and thus, she becomes ashamed of herself and ashamed of her own work. Disgruntled after a long day of school, Mio draws a short yaoi manga to alleviate some stress and hides it in a vanilla envelope. On her way home, she is stopped by a police officer who is doing a random check for counterfeit bills and requests to look at the contents of Mio's envelope. Flustered, Mio initially refuses and then tries to bribe the police officer to let her go. The officer does not cooperate and Mio breaks down mentally. She ends up surrendering herself so she can be arrested by the officer. All of this because of Japan's intrinsic inclination to embarrass and berate those who consider the self before the whole.
Mai, as opposed to her two counterparts in Yuuko and Mio, is actually a model student. She is silent and rarely says anything throughout the entire anime. She does nothing aside from what is expected from her and as a result she does not get into any trouble. She gets good grades, she doesn't goof around with Yuuko, she studies diligently when she gets home and she even finds time to read a book or two. However she is the least developed character once the 26th episode finishes, remaining stagnant during the entire series. Unwilling to deviate from the norm, Mai has set herself up for success and will continue upon this path well into the inhospitable and demanding work environment that awaits her. And it is here that the societal injustice is made clear to the audience, such that a lack of development is awarded with success, that only a willingness to follow in with the banality of culturally decided values will decide success.  The muffling of the student's voice, the stifling of its heart and passion, the forced whimpers of its youth, is the pathway to its prosperity in Japan. Such was the disgusted message of Keiichi Arawi.
However, the messages of Nichijou are not all bleak. Its childish demeanor is actually intentional and it tells the audience that a childlike optimism is needed to grapple with and overcome these issues. The happiest and most blissful character is actually Dr. Hakase, who is a child prodigy who had already attained her phD at the age of 8. She is unarguably the most successful person in the entire show, however she tackles life with vibrancy and wonder. She genuinely enjoys being alive. Through Hakase, Keiichi is showing the audience that there is hope, there is a way to break the mold. There should be no demoralization, there should be no karoshi. There is room in society for personal growth and personal happiness. Thinking of the self is also thinking of the whole.
Nichijou is an artistic masterpiece with its poetic narrative delicately interwoven with its rather childish art style and comforting sense of humour. No other anime has done what it has done, and as ambitiously as it has tried. It should be lauded for exposing the unjust pressures on the youth of Japan while also trying to rethink its intricate and ultimately counterproductive workplace environment.",Positif
"Nichijou is one of those hidden gems I'm glad I've spent some hours of my life watching it, and here's why (I guess).
Story - 9/10
Nichijou is an episodic anime for the most part. Each episode consists of random comedy sketches starring a vast cast of characters. Most scenes take place either at the school or at the Shinonome Lab.
Now, why is Nichijou so funny? Well, it's simple - Nichijou overly exaggerates the quotidian. For instance, there's a really famous scene where Yukko, one of the main characters, stabs her finger with her pencil. She then proceeds to fire an hyper beam out of her mouth
out of pain, destroying all the planets in our Solar System. Ridiculously hilarious.
Art - 10/10
At first sight, Nichijou looks like a lazy anime in terms of visuals: chibi characters, simple lines, nothing too flashy, etc. Like they say ""don't judge a book by its cover"". Nichijou's animation is so smooth at times that it will leave you speechless. A perfect example of its crazy animation is the chasing scene between Yukko and Mio on episode 2 (correct me if I'm wrong).
Sound - 9/10
I love the OST of this anime, it reminds me of shows like Tom and Jerry at times because of its expressiveness. From cheerful orchestrated songs to sad piano themes, Nichijou has it all. Most songs stuck with me weeks after finishing the anime so I guess that's also a positive aspect of it.
Character - 9/10
There are two main groups of characters in this anime: the school trio and the Shinonome Household.
The school trio consists of three close high-school friends: Yukko, the energetic goofball, Mio, the short-tempered manga artist and Mai, the silent prankster.
The Shinonome Household  is formed by Hakase, an 8 year old genius girl, Nano, a human-like robot created by Hakase herself, and, later on, by Sakamoto-san, a talking cat.
Each character has its own personality, they all feel different and unique. There isn't much character development though, but enough to make you attached to them in a matter of episodes.
Enjoyment - 10/10
This anime is hilarious. There wasn't a single episode where I didn't laugh, in fact, there were some scenes that straight up made me cry. Even though this is a comedy anime, there are some melancholic scenes, most of these are ironic but still. I also love the way Nichijou made me tear up a bit at the last episode (we're talking about a comedy anime here!)
Overall - 9/10
Nichijous is definitely one of my favorite shows of all-time - it's not perfect, but it is close, REALLY CLOSE to be. I seriously recommend you watching Nichijou if you want to laugh like crazy and feel good for a couple of hours (and cry too).
Now we just have to wait for Nichijou 2 or even an anime adaptation of Arawi Keiichi's CITY...",Positif
"Nichijou is by far one of the best shows I have ever seen.
This is just a a magnificent work of art.
The show is similar to Cartoon Network's Regular Show where the name of the show portrays it as a typical slice of life whereas the contents are opposite.
I mean, is it normal to look out the school hallway window only to see your principal wrestling a deer?
I was practically laughing throughout each episode and I still do when i remember some of the scenes.
Epic comedy show, great stress reliever, ""cute"" show?
I mean this anime is just lovely! One of the few ones that actually made
me laugh, and laugh hard.",Positif
"Well first of all, i must say that i had a lot of fun watching this anime than i could've ever imagine.
I'm not very good at detail so let me summarize.
After watching 5 eps. i wondered this is the most nonsense i've ever watched in my life
After finishing, i can proudly say this is the most funny nonense i've ever watched in my life.
And i'm glad that Nichijou is produced by KyoAni. It fits perfectly, the style, the character design, the moe element, everything was just so right. It reminds me about Lucky Star so much.",Positif
"My first review so here I go
This series has been my favorite of this year mainly because ""Slice of Life"" is my favorite genre of anime but also because it is the most random and hilarious series I have ever seen.
People bash it by saying it has no story well heres a news flash for those people, Slice of Life doesn't require a story pereod, the purpose of slice of life is to impersonate the everyday goings on of real life and thats that Nichijou does well but with an added twist of complete randomness and supernatural events such as
:SPOILERS:
Explosions, Energy Beams, Talking Animals,
Robots, Invincible people, Girl with heavy weaponry and a little girl professor.
:END OF SPOILERS:
So on to why I love this anime
It's difficult to explain why I love this series so much so Ill put it in simple terms.
If you love random events, hilarious characters and insane over-the-top moments then this anime is DEFINITELY FOR YOU.
If you don't love these things then watch it and you will love these things honestly there must be something wrong with those who do not find this anime funny because honest to ""insert god here"" this is the funniest anime I have ever seen because I have not laughed so hard at an anime before I saw this.
Although this anime has no story at all I still put it as a 10 so It can get a perfect rating =]",Positif
"In a nutshell, Nichijou is a set of short comic scenes, although related to each other.
Characters:
The main characters are school girls (First - emotionless girl, second - fujoshi mangaka, third - hyperactive genki) and loli-genius, that lives with speaking cat and a robot, that want to look like a normal girl. There are also a lot of interesting secondary characters, like shy moe teacher or wannabe aristocrat that rides his goat to school.
Story:
It has no beginning and ending, we can say that there is no plot. School girls just attend school. Absolute slice of life. The main merit of this title is its splendid humor
and atmosphere of daily life. The only one thing that happened is that robot-girl started to attend school.
Art and sound:
Despite it was made by Kyoto Animation, there is no their typical art style. Drawing is simple, but pleasant. Opening and ending themes are fun and rhythmical, background music is also good.
If you expect light, a bit crazy slice of life comedy, you will probably enjoy it.",Positif
"Nichijou was really funny overall. Haha, I've never laughed so much while watching a show. I really liked it, a lot, and I would definitely re-watch this show XD
Story: 7/10 - there isn't really an in-depth story line to Nichijou, so it is hard to rate it.
Art: 9/10 - The art styles are really well done. Especially in the funny parts where they exaggerate the scene with lots of colours.
Sound: 7/10 - I was laughing so much I barely heard the sound in the background, but the sound I did hear was actually exaggerated too, just like the colours in some of the funny
scenes. But it was good overall.
Characters: 9/10 - all of the characters were very different to each other, in a good way. Each one of them made me laugh in a different way, and it was brilliant.
Enjoyment: 10/10 - I really really enjoyed this show, funniest anime I have ever seen, I was practically crying I was laughing so much. I'd definitely recommend it to any one that watches anime, it's brilliant. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",Positif
"When getting into Nichijou one must know that's its a comedy series. Some people don't like comedy series due to its lack of plot, sometimes repetitive jokes or even because there not even that funny! I for one have watched a couple of series like Nichijou, Slice of life comedies. Mostly all of them are usually like 12-13 episodes long. Most of them get pretty repetitive and you don't really laugh. Nichijou has 26 episodes, wow.
I really liked it.
Its just something different while being the same. Its hard to explain, you'll need to watch it.
The comedy: Its simply refreshing, jokes come in any shape
and size and its variation is just the best. They rarely recylce jokes and heres the kicker, there actually funny! I found myself just laughing at the screen like an imbecile. Everything is just great, the expressions, the exaggeration at times, the general mood of everything. Its actually funny!
What adds to Nichijou is the art. It might look like whatever but its actually pretty beautiful, Its so simple yet so good. Everything from the detailed backgrounds to the characters. Its all collides in one beautiful cluster f@ck. One might not notice quickly but you'll come to love it.
The sound isn't really that memorable but it fits the atmosphere which is the important thing.
All in all, if your looking for a good comedy series to pass the time then look no further. This series will have you laughing, some stunts and jokes that you have never seen or consider will get you by surprise and make you laugh. Now i'll stop here so you can get watching.",Positif
"An intense action battle comedy disguised as a mere slice of life.
STORY
Despite being called Nichijou (literally 'daily life'/'slice of life'), characters in the show undergo the most extraordinary events you can imagine. I also really liked major plot developments through the show, such as Nano going to school, Yukko, Nano and Mai swearing to be friends forever with Mio, etc.
ART
Fantastic. Not only are things drawn well, they are animated fantastically as well. The changes in drawing styles of the characters are also a crucial part in the comedy. (You will see what I mean if you watch the show.)
SOUND
I was really impressed
with the background music. Each of them fit into the atmosphere so well, allowing the audience to be hooked onto whatever that's happening on the screen. Prime example is the music during the house of cards scene, the stuck lift scene, etc. Voice acting is also done very well, and in some parts make the show funnier than it already is.
CHARACTER
As mentioned before, the characters are developed well through the series. First of all this show has numerous characters and through the short intense funny scenes we get to know almost all of them. We see relationships between characters develop too, such as the good friends Yukko, Mio, Mai plus Nano, or the relationship between Misato Tachibana and Koujirou the goat guy.
ENJOYMENT
The jokes are fresh and truly hilarious... to some people. It is an established fact that the sense of humour that Nichijou has going for is not right for everyone. First few episodes of the anime make this pretty clear so if you found them enjoyable you are likely to enjoy the whole 24 episodes.",Positif
"(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)
Do you like random and crazy? Do you want to watch a show that takes the ordinary things in life and blows them out of proportion? Do you like good shows? Then this is the one for you! :)
STORY
The basic premise behind Nichijou is...that there isn't any premise at all. What the show likes to do is present the viewer with our ""main"" cast (Yukko, Mio, Mai, and Nano) in a variety of different situations ranging from stuck elevators to getting bit in the hand by a dog. Each may last for 20 seconds or go as long
as seven minutes or so, but any time in-between is perfectly valid. Sure, some of the small arcs are interconnected in small ways (such as a running bike from the previous short zooms by during the middle of the next), but most of these small stories are completely random and usually unrelated to anything else that has occurred. There are other supporting characters as well (too many to list) and they too are apart, either alone or with each other, in the zany and crazy stories that are told.
Is this a bad thing? Surprisingly no. It fits the show very well, and allows for you to just enjoy the moment for what it is. It was kind of interesting not having to worry about characters developing through drama or having a comprehensive world that fit the narrative, all of which was done quite on purpose. The chopped-up way in which everything is presented just adds to the hilarity and craziness of the entire show.
ANIMATION
From an outside perspective, one may think that the show is quite plain looking. And to a degree, that person would be correct. However, when you start actually watching the show do you realize how everything is actually extremely well animated. This is especially true for those over-the-top moments. The show does a fantastic job in terms of showing off effects, character movements, and background/foreground happenings.
I think it is because of this plain looking design that the studio behind Nichijou was able to animate everything incredibly well. There are other smaller details that usually occur too, such as nervous-sweat that constantly exudes from the student advisor to the sleeping bubble that protrudes from napping characters. And after getting half-way done with the show, who do I find out is the studio? KyoAni. I had no idea that they were behind this, but after finding this out, it made perfect sense why the animation itself was of such high quality.
I think it may be best to give an example. In the scene where ""Mio Goes Crazy"", the parts where she is flying through the air or beating up Yukko are not only hilarious, but are really well done. And this happens constantly. The show is good in terms of animation when everything is fine in the world, but when the scenario devolves into chaos, then the animation really gets kicked up a notch.
CHARACTERS
This section is difficult. For this type of show, I think everyone going in knows not to expect anything growth-wise with the characters. After all, it is, at its core, a comedy. As such, it really comes down to whether the person watching really loves the characters or not.
For me, I thought the main cast was wonderful. I liked Yukko and her stupid jokes, Mio's inability to deal with her need to draw BL manga, Mai for being just completely oblivious to anything else around her, Nano for always worrying about people finding out she is a robot, and Professor for being such an adorable kid. They each have their own personalities, but they can definitely change to fit the situation/mini-story at hand. Which is great, because that is what gives it the comedy that it does so well.
As for the rest of the cast (and there are a ton of other minor characters), I think the only others that I liked to watch were the student advisor and the teacher (the two that had feelings for one another), and the new Principal (the one who fought the deer). Besides them, the others were fun but nothing to really care too deeply about. Again, this doesn't necessarily hurt the show, since it simply relies on a wide variety of situations and characters in order to concoct many, many different small stories.
SOUND
For the first OP, I thought it was fine. The same for the first ED. The second ED was not that good to me, but I actually grew to like the second OP. The rest of the soundtrack isn't meant to be listened to on its own, but rather fit the situations as needed. As such, the OST is nothing too great.
However, I would like to commend the voice actors/actresses for the show, especially Yukko, Mio, Nano, and the Professor. I found their voices to be pretty unique, especially when the first two would get mad/angry. I felt like they gave it their all in their performances, and they never drop in consistency throughout the entire show.
ENJOYMENT
I have to reiterate to get the point across: you have to like random, you absolutely have to like over-the-top, in order to enjoy the show and its type of comedy. Luckily, I am pretty easy to get a laugh out of, so for the majority of the show, I was doing just that. This is another of my favorite scenes, just due to the scale of what I am talking about. If you laugh at this, then you are really going to like what the show offers. There's nothing more to it really. Certain brands of comedy are not to the liking of others (as with all things), but it is pretty easy to know early on whether you are going to enjoy 26 episodes of fun characters doing insanely crazy things!
I will say, some of the segments can be hit or miss, but they are almost always a hit. With that said, don't be too surprised if you find yourself not always laughing at what is going on on-screen. The show does try to do touchy-feely moments sometimes, but they pale in comparison to the comedy that it does so well.
SUMMARY
Story: Good, over 113 short stories compiled together to make many laughs and fun times
Animation: Great, KyoAni shows off their skills as usual, especially during all of the over-the-top moments
Characters: Good, while nothing ground-breaking, the characters themselves fit wonderfully with the world and give us the hilarity that ensues
Sound: Good, only the second OP is good, but it is some of the voice acting that really left an impression
Enjoyment: Good, I like this kind of comedy and the show makes you laugh through every single episode
Final Score: 8/10",Positif
"There's so little to say about this show, and yet so much.
Understand that while this show's humor is very off the wall at times, it knows what it is trying to be and it does it very well. Some have accused it of not conforming to the typical moe formula, but that is a good thing. It feels new.",Positif
"If I had to describe this anime in one word, I'd say it's hilarious. Nichijou is full of ironic situations, sarcasm, cheesy jokes, and just plain weird moments as a select few people progress through their daily life. Although the characters aren't as detailed drawing wise as I would have liked them to be, I couldn't help but laugh at the stupidity of the problems they get themselves into. Random is also a good word to describe Nichijou. Another good thing about this anime, is that if your TV and/or laptop for some reason decides not to let you finish an episode halfway through, but
it let's you watch the next one, yeah you may be missing out on some good jokes, but you won't miss much of the story. Honestly, there isn't much of a story to begin with. Just randomness. If you're ever in the mood for an anime that isn't in the horror/action adventure category, or you could use a good laugh to cheer you up, I recommend this anime 100%.",Positif
"Comedy is a most finicky beast, and ""Nichijou"" rides it with as much finesse as I've ever seen. Not that every joke lands, and of course there will be those who find none of the humor to be funny. However, with its range of comedy and overall skill, this series is a must-try!
The show is a compilation of short bits, distributed between the handful of main characters and their high-school antics/experiences. It plays out more like improvised skits than situation comedy, but somehow maintains a consistency between bits that allows for character and relationship development. Amazingly, Nichijou offers fresh jokes each episode and each bit
no matter how short is given a thoughtful ending (unlike a lot of improv).
Story [7/10]: Let's be real, neither comedy nor slice-of-life leaves room for much plot. Add in the fact that Nichijou is a high school anime told in bite-sized chunks, and the story is pretty much at an impasse. Therefore I was amazed to find that show does have an undercurrent of plot! The small storylines are neatly woven together, even finding such a proper and touching ending that no few anime shows lack.
Pacing [9/10]: I really admired the pacing of Nichijou. Each bit lasted from 30 seconds to a few minutes, but there were strategically placed breaks as well - moments of Zen, if you will. This was pure genius.
Art [8/10]: The art style of Nichijou resides somewhere between standard anime forms and chibi, so that all the forms are androgynously cute. Everything is brightly lit and colored to match the lighthearted tone, though be ready for endless sweat beads on the more anxious characters.
Sound [9/10]: Nichijou is one of the few anime where you can tell how much fun the voice actors and sound crew are having, and their joy is contagious.
Character [8/10]: Although the series is told in short segments, the characters still come alive piece by piece - each bit gives another snapshot of their personalities. It is surprising that the main characters are in fact complex, given how simplistic the anime seems at first. Each is playful and, frankly, adorable but has clear imperfections as well.
Enjoyment [10/10]: There's not much else to say except that I loved this series. It is definitely not for those unfamiliar with anime humor and style, and even for those who are, it has a lot of purely Japanese jokes (e.g. puns and cultural humor). I didn't follow some of these, and can only imagine how much better it would have been if I could!
Overall: [9/10]",Positif
"Nichijou may just be the funniest and most well thought out anime I've ever seen in my life. It's not about the plot, it's really not. Sure, there's a few plotlines that continue over episodes, but the focus of the series isn't telling a typical story, and that's something that was new to me. The most accurate thing I can compare it to is probably the surrealist episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion. It's a beautiful show, and it's absolutely hilarious. All of the characters stick with you, and every single scene is interesting and original. The animation is also my favourite animation in any show,
and the facial expressions and reactions of the characters are to die for. Please watch this show, it's a masterpiece.",Positif
"This is my first review so bare with me.
Nichijou or My Ordinary Life is a comedy, school and slice of life anime.
If you're not interested in watching these kind of genres as school life isn't very interesting to watch then don't worry. There is NOTHING ordinary about this anime.
Think of Kuroko no Basuke. That is one of the best anime with exaggerations which makes it look so dam awesome. Nichijou takes that to a whole new level.
This anime is the most light-hearted and cheerful anime i've ever seen.
Story: There is absolutely no story. You can watch it from any episode and still get 95%
of what's happening.
7
Art: The art is extremely unique and light-hearted.It fits everyone's personality and the environment really well.
10
Sound: The voice acting flawlessly matches the characters espicially the 3 mains girls or the most screen time. I loved both openings and endings. During the anime the soundtrack was perfect for the atmosphere and situation.
9
Character: There a heaps of characters but the main ones are the one's in the picture. They are SO FLIPPING FUNNY. What really impressed me was that how you got to see other students as well. you'll understand if you watch it which i recommend you do.
10
Enjoyment: 10
ye that's right
Now for the genre the anime was listed.
Comedy, School and Slice of Life.
For comedy i give this anime and 11. Yes I'm serious. I laughed every episode at the weird jokes, the over-the-top EVERYTHING.
For school and slice of life i give it a 9.
The reason is that there is so many things you an relate to in this anime. (If you're a high school student). But i did not give this a 10 because how it never ever goes to the extent in which this anime does.
But that's why i love this anime.
I definitely recommend watching this if you want to watch something that is not serious in any way and just wanna laugh.",Positif
"Nichijou is a fantastic addition to the Comedy / Slice-of-Life genre. While detracting from the normal (much like Azumanga) it still presents much more ""normal"" concepts.
The characters represent standard stereotypes, but overall appear much more developed and enjoyable. The events that take place can be simple, such as taking a test or eating lunch, but can suddenly explode into a flurry of ""WHAT THE...?!?"" in a matter of seconds. Like other Slice-of-Life shows, Nichijou lacks a plot, but it makes up for that with its screwball comedy and solid characters.
The art and sound stand out among (almost) every other anime. The artistic flow follows
the action in the story. Tense scenes give the characters and setting stricter expressions. Light-hearted moments are drawn very light and give a sense of childish amusement. The art makes up most of my love for the show. The choice for the intro and ending is quite strange (yet interesting and fitting). Some might find it more appealing than others. Asides from that, humorous sound effects and excellent voice acting complete the set.
The comedy is occasionally hard to grasp, there are several pokes at Japanese culture, and a whole scene aimed at Japanese puns and plays-on-words. There is still a lot of slap-stick and simpler jokes to understand though, which aims to amuse a wide audience. On the topic of Audience, the show seems to aim only at a teenage age group, but around the 17th episode and beyond, there are some included sections which are aimed at an older audience. One of the older characters on the show speaks often of the past, and speaks with his grandchild often. His lines, I would say, attempt to instill nostalgia among older viewers. Every audience can be satisfied with Nichijou.
Overall, Nichijou is a rare and extremely enjoyable experience. It sucks you into their world and attempts to keep you. I was hoping for a second season, but so far it seems like nothing has been released. An excellent one-shot, and an amazing experience for those who are curious about the Slice-of-life genre.",Positif
"Nichijou is still my number #1 favourite anime of all time, which is weird considering it's a slice of life comedy. Like I've watched way cooler plot heavy stuff but still here I am.
Nichijou's comedy is derived from creating hyperbole like reactions from normal life inconveniences/situations. Kyoto really blew the budget on everything just to emphasise all of that also, there really isn't any holding back. I can definitely see it being hit or miss however.
Nichijou always gives me this homely childlike wonder when ever I watch it when it combines its beautifully composed orchestral pieces and light coloured and simplistic art style with a
very relaxed pacing at times. This is all of course used as a juxtaposition for when shit hits the fan and the animation budget goes from like a 5 to 11 and the orchestra turns into some intense Mozart shit when the slightest first world inconvenience happens.
I'm not a big fan of lol random XD humour but mostly because of how easily it is done wrong in mainstream media or anywhere really. This show is a big example on how random humour can be done correctly with well constructed pacing, setting and characters.
It's also got the right amount of heart felt moments you can expect from a normal Kyoto slice of life anime.
It's really sad that the show was a critical failure with Kyoto investing a huge amount of money in it and it didn't catch on therefore getting rid of all future hope for another season. I would kill for the show to come back after it's finally earned the audience it didn't get when it came out. The fabled 'season 2' will definitely not happen however it'd be fun for CITY to get it's own show.",Positif
"Nichijou has got to be one of the best Slice of Life anime ever. It's not your ordinary Slice of Life because the way they act is so random and dumb and it's a good thing.
There is no story. Rather, it focuses a lot more on their everyday lives. There are two main ""everyday lives"" on this anime. The first trio are Mio, Yuuko and Mai and the other trio are Hakase, Sakamoto and Nano.
There are a lot of Slice of Life shows that are so boring. However, this anime takes it on a whole new level by making a lot of parts exaggerated and
unrealistic which just works a lot. How? The humor of this show. I think it's safe to say that this show has the best comedy. I know, there's Gintama but, I have not watch that show (For how lengthy it is but I will watch that soon). There are indeed some parts on this anime that I didn't get but, most of the parts (Especially Yuuko's parts) are somewhat similar to my life when we get in on these situation. Except, this anime exaggerates it to the point where it looks unrealistic which is even funnier.
The animation of this show is top-notched as expected from Kyoto Animation. Sure, it isn't realistic but the art-style is very unique and it's sparks my eyes on how beautiful the artwork is. The animation fits the show itself. There are just many parts of this show that the animation looks like when they exaggerate a lot of parts like Mio running to get her notebook back. They didn't made it look simple. They made it like this is some sort of action film which, I was very impressed. The soundtrack of this anime is also outstanding. It just fits on every part of the show and the soundtrack aren't even forgettable. The opening theme is also very good. Hyadain did a great job performing both of it's opening themes which I find it surprising that even on the girl's part, it was him who was singing.
For the characters, I do admit that this anime adds so much cast but, I don't think they are forgettable. I can remember so many characters because the anime gives them the chance to shine.
I'll go with the first trio first. Yuuko is an energetic girl though, she's also lazy. She keeps forgetting her assignment and because of that, she copies her assignments from Mio. This is my favorite character of the series because on how I can relate to her a lot in a lot of her situations that she has been through. Mio on the other hand is the opposite. She is hardworking but, what they both have in common is that they are both energetic and cheerful. Mai is the quiet girl but, she is somewhat the troll of the series.
For the other trio we have Hakase Shinomoe. She is a Scientist/Professor who invents a lot of stuff like robot but, she's just a kid and has childish personalities which... can be cute for some. Nano is one robot of Shinomoe except she acts like human and she has a personality. She has a kind personality but, really disciplines Shinomoe well. Sakamoto is the pet of the three. He is a cat but, he acts old (Because he is older). However, that doesn't stop him from acting like what cats do.
Overall, I enjoyed the show. This show gave me a barrel of laughs. Even if you dislike Slice of Life, I highly recommend this show. It's not your ordinary Slice of Life which is ironic because Nichijou translates as My Ordinary Life.

OLD REVIEW WAS DELETED SINCE IT WAS POSTED TO SOON
-SPOILER FREE-
Saiki Kusuo no Ψ nan is a comedy slice-of-life story about Saiki Kusuo who has special powers that allow him to do pretty much anything.
The Episodes are not very long with around 4-5 min per episode but the episodes are coming out almost daily right now.
Story: 8/10
There is no core story as there is always another core in each episode, but the main story (that is that Saiki Kusuo has special powers) still affects all episodes.
There are some surprising moments that really catch you off guard and you never expected.
Art: 8/10
The art is very
beautiful with good animation and good character design and all characters are very different!
Sound: 9/10
The voice acting is good and the intro song is very catchy, there is no outro song. The background music/sounds are fitting and enjoyable.
Edit:
There is an outro in the 20-minute version (I watch the 5-minute version so there isn't for me)
Character: 10/10
The Characters are all unique and well-written, and the characters show a clear relation to each other.
Someone else pointed out that every character follows a cliché, for example, the sports loving class rep, the stupid delinquent or the beautiful girl everyone gets nervous around.
Enjoyment: 10/10
The Series is very enjoyable with lots of funny jokes and interesting character development!
Overall: 10/10
I recommend this anime to everyone, it's funny, well written and definitely not a waste of your time! Give it a try!
Edit after watching 56 episodes:
The more you watch the most things Saiki does, one of the jokes is also the writer making stuff up on the spot and Saiki commenting on that breaking the 4th wall, relationships are also (in a sense) build trough the series
-Laurin",Positif
"Aired during the Summer and Fall 2016 seasons, Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan is (hopefully just for now) a hidden gem in comedy anime that I can't recommend enough to watch.
The protagonist in this story, Saiki, is a boy that was born with psychic powers in a normal world. He can read minds, he can teleport from one place to another, he can restore things (people included) to their previous state in the past… and these three are just a few examples of all that he can do. Saiki is so powerful that, if he wanted to, he could singlehandedly take control of the Earth in
a few days, is that his intention? Hell no! He just wants to live a quiet life, and I can already tell you that he isn't even close to have one.
From his family, to his classmates, to seemingly anyone he meets, everyone is a weirdo, and they are all hilarious and awesome in their own way and won't let Saiki alone for a second. There is Shun, the chuunibyou that believes in the existence of Dark Reunion, an evil organization that only he can defeat (even if in reality he is a complete weakling), Nendou, a character that is so empty-headed that Saiki is not able to read his mind, Teruhashi, a girl that is considered perfect by everyone (especially herself), and so, so many other awesome characters that will grow up on you and make you laugh so much.
Saiki itself is a fantastic and unique character, he's a straight man (and the only sane person around) that doesn't fully act like one, instead of shouting like it's the usual, he stays silent for the other characters, and we can listen to him internally complaining in his normal tone, there is something so funny about seeing him wondering what the hell is wrong with everyone, all while keeping his trademark deadpan face, that rarely changes outside of when near his biggest weakness: coffee jello, he absolutely loves it and he will do anything for them.
The variety that having psychic powers provides to the story makes this anime so great, every episode feels very different to the others thanks to the multiple uses that they have. The humor itself is quite fast paced, and manages to be constantly funny, you will be laughing all the time while watching this anime. All the side characters get the right amount of screen time to become memorable, yet never feel like they are overused. The 4th wall breaks are fantastic, and I really have to mention the parodies, that are mostly from other popular games and series that everyone knows about, so one is not left with a “well, I don't get it” reaction everytime they happen.
The art style and animation of this anime is honestly pretty average, it doesn't look bad, but it's definitively not a high budget work at all, I personally don't give much value to that since the main objective in this type of stories is to make us laugh, and actually, if used properly, that can work  pretty well in their favour, this can be especially be seen in scenes featuring Nendou, where the intention is to make him look as derp as possible and that helps making it even better.
In the sound department, as most of the time with comedies, the songs are quite forgettable and mostly there to simply go along with the events that happen, there is one big exception though, and it's the “JUDGEMENT KNIGHTS OF” song that follows some Shun scenes and makes them so much better. Both two opening and ending themes are pretty good, especially “Ψ desu I LIKE YOU”, the first ending theme (or the opening one if you watch the shorts), that is a very catchy song.
This next and final point is meaningless for the new watcher now that this anime finished, but I really need to still mention it, Saiki Kusuo aired as both a series of shorts (4 minutes episode per weekday, being 5 episodes in total each week) and one episode each Sunday, that was all of the shorts from that week together, this format was simply fantastic and I want it so much to become more popular in the future. In my timezone it meant that each weekday, when I woke up, I had one new episode available, there is simply no better way to start the day than with a good laugh, and I appreaciated it so much.
In conclussion, Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan is a very original and hilarious comedy, full of lovable characters that will make you laugh from start to end. If you're a fan of comedy anime, make sure to watch this one, and if you aren't, I still heavily recommend you to give it a try, because it's probable that it will greatly surprise you!",Positif
"You're in a crowd of people and trying to hide from a really creepy dude that you know from school or work. Luckily, he hasn't noticed you yet.
You probably want to do the best you can to get out of his line of sight... right? So you've finally managed to make it behind him, but then, just as you think that you're safe, the creepy dude stays facing forward, but SWIFTLY does a horrifying 180-degree HEAD-ONLY turn. He then, with a derp face, looks SOLELY at you out of everybody in the crowd. In a shocking development, you've somehow been spotted! That ""wtf moment"" that
you'd experience makes for comedy at its finest! You will find that type of comedy and much, much more in Saiki Kusuo no psi-nan.
Funny does not even begin to describe this anime! That's right, it's hilarious! It's one of the best, if not the best, comedy anime that I've ever seen. It's very original and has definitely become my new favorite comedy anime.
TL;DR at end
Story: 10/10
Saiki, the main protagonist, comically takes being overpowered to a whole new level. He's basically a god-level psychic that can do anything. He's smart, has x-ray vision, one punch man level strength (or maybe All Might?), time warping, can change the laws of the universe, has telepathy, teleportation, memory wiping, there's basically nothing this guy can't do. The story follows him in his everyday life as he, an extremely superior being, has to deal with ordinary folk. He's a pretty sarcastic guy and is always doing a hilarious internal commentary about the bothersome events that happen to him throughout the anime. There is no overarching goal of the plot (it's kind of just a linear succession of skits). The pacing is often very fast, but I think that its speediness actually benefits the series because the series continuously hits you with jokes like they're bullets from a machine gun (if some jokes miss, np there are like 20 more incoming). I truly cannot imagine how they could have improved the story in this series. This story's comedy is a 10/10 masterpiece.
Art: 6/10
The artwork was very plain and the animation was a bit choppy, but it didn't take away from the series in my opinion. The simple art may have actually enhanced the series in a way. Perhaps you would have missed the comedy if you were too focused on the art? Who knows, but there's really not much to talk about when it comes to the art.
Sound: 10/10
I loved the opening of the 4-minute shorts. The background music were mostly very unique, well-suited, and catchy (8.5/10 for music). I think it should be strongly noted that the sound effects were masterful in this series. Sound effects in anime often go unnoticed, but this anime’s sound effects really enhanced the comedy if you took notice of them. The voice acting was absolutely fantastic! The diverse characters and their personalities were well acted out by each of the voice actors/actresses. Normally music is what largely determines the score when it comes to sound, but I feel the other areas of the sound were so strong that this category actually does indeed deserve a 10/10.
Character: 10/10
A riveting cast set of mostly original characters. I mean, c'mon. This anime had a fucking “Nendou”. Once I discovered this “Nendou” creature, I just knew that the characters deserved a 10/10. Just kidding, but in all seriousness, this series had many really diverse characters including: a Nendou, dramatized narcissistic perfect girl who attracts everybody but Saiki, average girl, chuunibyou guy character, thug character, tsundere grandpa, workaholic, deliberately annoying kids, shitty magicians--- there’s too much substance here to list them all! All of the main characters get pretty well developed as well.
Enjoyment: 10/10
This series had me laughing very hard every day! The simple and fast humor was perfect for my tastes. Often other popular comedy anime, like Nichijou for example, take much too long to get the jokes across and consequently make the watchers feel bored. Saiki Kusuo no Psi-nan usually hits you with the jokes so fast and repeatedly that you only have a few moments to let it sink in before it hits you with the next one. I’m so glad this anime had a bold, new type of episode design where it did 4-minute comedy sketches released once a day (most days). I was so excited to watch a fun new skit from this series every day. At the end of the weeks, the five 4-minute sketches were compiled into a single normal-length episode. I think this anime will be setting the precedent for future 4-minutes-a-day comedy anime. I look forward to season 2!
Overall: 10/10
TL;DR
This is one of the funniest comedy series I’ve ever seen! You WILL laugh if you watch this series. The story was non-complex and in the form of multiple short skits with no overarching unifying plot (It’s just following Saiki as he lives his god-like superior being life). The art was pretty basic, but it didn’t take away from the series much. The background noises and voice acting were all great, but the opening song and the “shit’s going down” BGM were the only memorable OSTs for me. The main characters were all very unique, diverse, added to the comedy, and well developed by the end of the series.
Should you watch this series?
If you’re looking for a comedy series, then hell yeah you should!
If you want to try a new type of series that you haven’t seen before, yeah watch it!
If you’re looking for a sci-fi, then ehh it’s not THAT sci-fi related but you can give it a shot.
If you’re looking for a serious, complex, and/or linear plot with an end-goal, then you’re definitely in the wrong place buddy.
This series was too great! You should definitely watch it!

"I personally think that this is the best physic anime your probably ever going to watch.  It has great comedy and this serious attitude of the character just makes it more hilarious. Of coarse this is my opinion you don't have to agree with it. It also has a certain comedy that probably only a few like. I don't like the fact that it's only 5 mins last time the made a anime out of it they only had one episode I'm not sure if the other adaption was a OVA or not. But I definite recommend this show I just hope it does
well in the future",Positif
"With the abundance of short four minute episode anime becoming increasingly more common every anime season, Saiki-kun felt like a breath of fresh air from the same boring and tiring formula that has been used ever so frequently.
One thing that works in favour of the show above others of the same format is that Saiki-kun lasted for many more episodes while also airing a new episode everyday. My main problem with these types of shows is the weekly formula as they're airing; once the episode stops and the next one begins the following week its hard to keep track of what has happened and the
show feels like it is going nowhere. Sure, this problem is eliminated after the show has finished airing but the lack of episodes also means a lack of characterisation and story progression which, fortunately, Saiki-kun does not lack.
Saiki-kun tells the story of a teenager who has physic powers but ends up living a life in which these powers are more of an annoyance then a gift. The show follows his life and how he uses these various powers for different situations; very basic stuff for a basic type of show. But the main strength of this show lies in its comedy and its characterisation. Each character has an interesting gimmick and quirky personality which all bounce off each other  rather effectively throughout the show as they find themselves in various scenarios and situations. Most characters have more depth and personality traits to them then just what is on the surface which invokes a lingering sense of anticipation as each character will act in a different way based on the situation at hand keeping the comedy fresh and interesting.
There is also a variety in jokes keeping the comedy from becoming too stale or repetitive and the four minute formula only helps with this. There are also many references in the show to other manga and anime, which if you're like me, then you'll enjoy since I like referential comedy. What's good about this show is that it doesn't rely solely on references (which can become tiresome after a while) as most of the comedy is derivative of the interaction between the characters. In terms of an over-arching story there is really none aside from a few mini-arcs which sees one particular scenario play across a multitude of episodes. The animation and art style were not always the best and could at times look plain ugly and strange but it was nothing bad enough to take any pleasure away from the overall experience.
In conclusion, Saiki-kun was a refreshing four minute show that actually has substance with fun characters and great comedy. I would recommend it.",Positif
"This incredible show can redefine how you view anime. My initial reaction, mentally, was to fault it for the continuous expositional dialogue from the protagonist. In visual media and in general in creative works, it's often a crutch substituting a good character introduction and development, but in Saiki Kusuo the stream-of-consciousness style grows on you as innovative and postmodern and eventually it plays on essential role to the themes of the anime. It's a really interesting narrative style that adds a lot to the characters.
The art style stands out as distinct but at the same time seems very natural. Something that stood out to me
is that minor or background characters have thought put into their designs and they're distinguishable, which is something that can't be said even for many good shows. It goes out of its way to explain why the main character looks so conspicuously like a protagonist and justifies the weirdness of the hair styles of the other characters and not only is it not presented in a way one would expect, but it's pretty funny.
The meta-ness is also unique. Certain elements of meta-humor have become cliche, and the anime in several instances subverts the expectation that it will follow a particular meta-trope by setting it up and them subverting it. That's honestly remarkable. That's not to say it's flawless in its approach, but when a joke about some trope itself has become a trope, you can expect some interesting deviation. One beautiful thing is that, in a way, Saiki personally takes on the role of the frame. He takes responsibility for making the world is different from our own in ways that many shows take for granted, while also justifying the omniscience as a first person point of view.
The characters are interesting and capture the youthful aggrandizement of the world that distinguishes those memories from their experiences. Not only can the viewer see how everything feels more important in the moment, but the dissonance felt as a result is clearly intentional. Also, there seem to be fairly few genuinely one-dimensional characters, and since the anime isn't over yet there is some benefit of the doubt since so far it has been quite effective in bringing back previously less-developed characters and building on them.
The characters themselves don't take the premise for granted, which is also a relieving departure. That's not to say a show needs the premise to be acknowledged by its characters, but it's so rare for the atypical to be recognized as such that it's a breath of fresh air. The explanation of extremely commonly occurring story-telling tropes usually taken for granted is great.
This is a great anime that stands out in a variety of ways and manages to do almost everything well. The best thing is that it gradually seems to add more and more to the world as it progresses, but in such a way that the premise doesn't get repetitive or exhausting, often when it's least expected. Everyone and everything is developed, and not just linearly. It isn't constant joke after joke, but the comedy lining the series is well set up. There is so much value in this anime and I'd encourage anyone to experience it for themselves and I cannot wait to see where it'll go next!",Positif
"Saiki K is an hilarious low-energy gag comedy. It uses the power of 5 min attention span and high speed incantation dialogues to deliver a climax and a cliff hanger at once. Jare jare….
The cover art and the synopsis may be off putting, but believe me, this is worth your time. I binged this whole anime in just 2 days. What makes it so watchable is it non-cliché jokes and low-energy main character.
ÒꙍÓ ART ÒꙍÓ
The animation style of Saiki K is simple and pleasing. The emphasis lays on it’s dialogue rather than an impressive background or action showdown. The animation for Saiki’s powers are well
done and not to lazy.
ÒꙍÓ SOUND ÒꙍÓ
As I said earlier, the dialogues sound like high speed incantations (on Netflix) and that was okayish I guess. It was sometimes annoying, because I had to read super-fast but it was doable for a veteran dub reader. Having a simple background with not to much going on made it easier.
The voice acting is what makes Saiki K so good. The character can convey their dumbness across the screen. Unbelievable. Its loveable, good and done just right. You can almost feel what the characters feel. As for Nendo, you gotta be smart to act so dumb.
ÒꙍÓ CHARACTERS ÒꙍÓ
The cast is what made this anime so enjoyable. Being a gag comedy, the plot is almost non-existent. It follows Saiki K in high school. That is kinda it. But how they experience their high school time is fantastic. The characters have their own distinct traits and are predictable, yet they don’t behave to much of a cliché. They all have something which makes them a bit unique and interesting. I would totally simp for the perfect girl Teruhashi.
Saiki, the star of the anime, is so damn funny. He isn’t to bother by the people he tries to escape and he has a heart. When problems arise he doesn’t act like a hero but he does what he must (to maintain his peace). He is quit flexible and that was something that surprised me a few times. It creates a very dynamic setting for new jokes and disasters. Luckily the use of his powers is done very creative and logical. He is very powerful but it has also some drawbacks. And this also adds a lot to the comedy factor. Look forward to see his reactions.
ÒꙍÓ ENJOYMENT ÒꙍÓ
I was surprised at how entertaining this was. It was easy to keep on watching and trying to discover new scenario’s with Saiki. I really ship him with Teruhashi as she is a perfect girl. I would only recommend this if you like gag anime with a touch of slice of life/ high shool. This is by far one of the best comedy anime I’ve seen so far (not so much but still).",Positif
"An anime that is so easily dismissed and left out was easily my favorite anime of not only the season but also for the entire year. Last year I felt there was no shortage of good anime. From seasoned veterans like JoJo to new shows like Mob Psycho, there was no dearth of anime I enjoyed. But between good shows there was another one which for me was great and arguably the greatest of them all. As this is a review for Saiki Kusuo (too long a name to write in full), there would be no prize for guessing the best of the lot. 5
mins a day, for 5 days a week, this anime consistently delivered big on laughs. Containing with itself all sorts of humor from slapstick to deadpan, this 5 min. anime was a treasure chest filled with rich laughs.
The premise of the anime was simple, it follows the life of protagonist Saiki who was born with superpowers, as he navigates through various scenarios of school life interacting with various people. These powers that range from telekinesis to transformation are all not a convenient gift, they also cause minor inconveniences. Each of the episode time just above 4 min and have a different stories. Earliest episodes include Saiki dealing with his over enthusiastic but simple parents, as the series progressed we become introduced to other lively characters at his school. Again, the early episodes were used to introduce characters, set up their personalities and to showcase Saiki's relationship with them. As the show progressed the stories used these characters like paint, they were mixed and match together creating hilarious situation for Saiki as he dealt with not only the characters but with the mess they created. Another impressive thing about the anime was how it dealt with introducing characters. A lot of characters were introduced at early stages of the anime. Then the anime focused on their relationship with Saiki. When the same characters were used multiple times the show introduced new characters. Also, unlike anime like Sket Dance, all the new characters weren't introduced simultaneously; rather they were introduced over a period of time. Often not more than one character was introduced at a time. As soon as a character was introduced, the character's relation with Saiki and co. was displayed, and just when things were starting to go stale another character was introduced, launching more permutation and combination into the mix. This way throughout 120 or 24 depending on the version, the anime was able to retain its charm and freshness.
The show had a huge cast. The good thing about having a huge cast is to have a variety of personalities. This can be both good and bad, depending on the mangaka. Though Saiki uses this to its advantage in a big way, probably the anime's biggest strength. All, I mean every single character had something to contribute. Every character had a different personality and each personality brought with it, its own brand of humour. From Saiki's deadpan-sarcastic style to Kaido's delusions humor to Nendou's dumb humor to Teruhashi's obsessed girl, to name a few; like this every character brought something new to the show. Every character a different color in the beautiful painting. None of the character will feel repetitive or tedious. From the moment they enter to the moment they sign off, each character was an absolute delight to watch.
The art and sound had nothing much to complain about, not that the anime itself had many complaints. They were pretty standard. Though I personally would give a shout out to both openings. A good opening, I feel, helps set the tone of the show. In this anime both the openings were cheerful and joyous, and helped set a merry mood. They were absolutely catchy to me and despite not being a Japanese, I couldn't help but hum the tune occasionally.
At long last, I would say that this little anime is absolutely worth the watch and deserves way more applause than it receives. To be honest, I too skipped on this one, due to episode's duration; albeit the very thing that made me skip it made me watch it. The duration per episode, it was perfect to watch as a break in between exams. Though once I started it I watched almost 30 episodes of it at once. After that everyday watching the 5 mins of the show and anticipating the next episode for 23hrs and 55 mins became part of my schedule. Thus, as said earlier this anime is perfect for the watchers who are looking for something hilarious and fun to watch and stress off on.",Positif
"Saiki is an anime about a boy who has psychic powers but despite this awesome gift he is very pessimistic
Story: The story isn't really anything special but this anime doesn't particularly need anything grand as its very episodic and cut up in 5-minute segments.
Art: Pretty awful to be honest. Characters aren't ugly but the animation is so lazy.
Sound: The voice acting was fine, and they have some nice quirky sound effects which can be quite charming
Characters: Saiki is a funny character and is quite relatable in his thinking, however, the surrounding characters are very over the top and can sometimes be funny, but other
times annoying
Enjoyment: This is just pure fun and something light-heart to put on in the background. The humour was funny at first but after a few hours of watching it became mundane.",Positif

"Anime, as a medium, does not leave me all that satisfied when it comes to the comedy genre. I can count around 4-5 comedy series that managed to get some enjoyment out of me. Two examples would be Cromartie High School and Nichijou. The former, except of being a top-notch comedy series with many bizarre happenings and wacky moments, is also an excellent parody of immeasurable things, including capitalism, gangs, the toll that technology takes on us people, and many many more. The latter is more of an incredible comedy with its fair share of wacky moments on the one hand, exquisite art on the
other, also working as a successful parody of moe (K-on, Lucky Star, etc. You do know the deal, I bet).
Checking last season's line-up, quite the amount of series spiked my interest. I stumbled across this entry called ""Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan"" (I am fortunate because I am Greek, otherwise I would have to use ""Psi""). What I got out of a first taste of the thingy was:
>Comedy
>5 minutes per episode
I backed away immediately when I read the two factors above. A short, and a comedy at that? All I got was an intuition that it would definitely fail. However, my prejudice got proved wrong. After pushes from several people, I decided to give its first episode a try. What I found out is that I could not stop pressing the ""next episode"" button. That's the moment when I said to myself that yup, Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan might have been able to measure up to the several anime comedies that I loved. It truly did, I presume. It even managed to refer to my given examples pricelessly.
The series is about your dude named Saiki Kusuo, who has a lot of psychic powers on his hands, ranging from telekinisis to reading minds to changing sceneries and perceptions of other people. This might sound awesome to some, but our man does not agree. He thinks that harboring all those powers is a hassle most of the times. Letting alone that he does not care about almost anyone, he just wants to lead a calm life, not get into the center of attention that would have been possible hadn't he been who he was, and not get involved with many kinds of people in a more personal manner. Unfortunately for him, that ain't gonna be the case, because he makes many encounters on the way.
There is not a specific plot we could speak about, because the series is strictly episodic, except in some cases where few-episode arcs are evident. The pacing is very fast, as expected from a short and wacky comedy at that, but not in a way that it might feel unnatural in a way. The series itself is quite random of course, but it manages to be satisfying when it comes to pacing and transitions. Especially the transitions, which fit incredibly well with the main point of the series, its all-around pleasing spontaneousness. In contrast with that, it usually takes place at Saiki's home and/or the school he attends.
In addition, Saiki-Kusuo no Ψ-nan manages to bring about a great sense of how cliches should be handled. The dude who wants to lead a peaceful life, the narcissistic girl, the eighth year syndrome pupil, the hyped and hyperkinetic youth, the perverted pal who also has psychic powers, the lad who can not think, moms and dads that fight a lot yet love each other. The whole run is plagued with anime cliches, something that usually does not work well. With Saiki Kusuo though, it was more than triumphant.
Consequently, we strive towards the character section. The whole cast is, for the lack of a better term, hilarious. Not as much the cliches they represent, but the interactions in between, and the situations they are orchestrated to follow. Whether it be slapstick, or wackiness, or long monologues that our main character tends to have, the show relies heavily on its characters. One or two jokes might be able to slip out of my line of perception, but other than that, the humor hits home. That is one thing that this series should not be missed for.
Even if it was not one of its main intentions to develop characters of course, some change between the starting and ending episodes can be detected in the long run. Still managing to representing cliches in a really pleasing way, Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan manages to make our tremendously fun cast to evolve, especially the main character. This change, as I would name it, is mostly evident towards the series' end. Along with this partial development come the emotional scenes, which work surprisingly well.
The art and animation are digestible for a short. There is this short episode which explains as of why all the characters have weird hair styles and harbor strange accessories and clothes in many of the circumstances, and how Saiki changed those things. (And then you might think about why he has those strange game machine-like thingies on his head.) Just thinking about that makes me laugh further more. The backgrounds are nice, though not something I would bother talking a lot about. Character designs, in general, are a joy to bestow, because of the factors mentioned above.
Soundtrack-wise, the opening is full of wack and a nice way to prepare for the short heaven that one single four minute episode might be. The tracks included are not all that memorable to me, to be completely honest, because I was way too busy noticing other things. There is no ending to speak of.
Enjoyment: 9/10
No doubts about it, I managed to enjoy Saiki-Kusuo no Ψ-nan to the fullest. Revealing one more counterpart of Saiki's life per second episode was really fun. The hilarious interactions were quite the sight. The humor, as in overall, smelled success, and some of the supernatural elements were interesting to say the least. I am more than glad to have watched this anime, especially when it did not take all that much of my time in the first place.
Overall: 7/10
In conclusion, I am going to thank J.C.Staff for brightening my days with this piece. Following it for one season made it seem like it was something that was important for the anime industry. A really funny short that can bring many kinds of inventions to the table. Definitely one of the best series of 2016, along with JoJo, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, Mob Psycho 100 etc.
Thanks for reading this review, feedback shall always be appreciated. I am bound to upload more!",Positif
"""Here's a another gag anime about an all powerful character, I think we had Sakomoto last season already ?"" - if you are having these same thoughts then... well you are missing out on a lot of fun and laughter that so many animes fail to achieve these days.
Sakomoto wasn't bad, but I didn't find it much appealing either. But this show achieves what Sakomoto probably failed at ..... I m still laughing at the jokes and sarcasm thrown at me even after 30 episodes and (obviously) not yet bored by the mc.
Man, I haven't had a good laugh watching anime in a long
time. It's not only this intriguing mc but also the characters surrounding him which amuses me. Yea, they are a kind-of cliched characters we have all been seeing in animes for an eternity but still...they are different...they are funnier!
After watching the first 30 episodes I could conclude that the voice actors are well chosen and it is probably them that gives this show another light and distinguishes itself 100s of wannabe gag-animes. Paticularly the mc's voice actor, our very own, Kamiya hiroshi fits in too well with the mc as if he is Saiki himself. The pauses and the emphasis of his sarcasm on the absurdities he faces in his not-so-average life are remarkably well executed by Hiroshi. Yeah, I have come to the point where I can't imagine Saiki to be voiced by anyone but Hiroshi.
And unlike Sakomoto, the fact that every other character (be it male or female) doesn't fall for the mc due to his ""coolness"" gives me at least one more reason to watch the show.
The fact that it's not a single continuous 23 mins long ep each week but a 5 mins ep each day fits in perfectly with the comedic environment of the show. Now, I have strangely got addicted to this show that I find it as my daily source of fun and laughter, be it only for 5 mins.
Though I can't call it a masterpiece just yet, but unlike other animes this season, it is probably the only anime that has still kept me hooked!",Positif
"MUST WATCH ANIME
Hilarious! My #1 pick for this season.
At first you may be wondering when you watch this ""really?"" ""What the...""
But this is comedy guys and just let yourself take the ride
AND best part. Have your questions. Wonder, ""how the heck did he...?""
And be amazed. Because all of your questions, and I mean ALL of your questions will be answered.
And start to wonder.... is SAIKI REALLY PSYCHIC!? IS HE WATCHING US WATCH HIM!?
haha... but seriously guys, don't be too serious and enjoy the show!
Lots of laughs to come.
Art is fitting for this anime.
Not too much of a storyline, other than basically slice
of saiki's life. And how everything kind of revolves around him. But its a comedy and its great.
Sound....? all I can say is... ""Oh..."" That's all you need. ;]
Characters. Nendou is personally my favorite. Love the types of archetypes the creator brings in.
Enjoyment. Extreme. I'm almost always laughing every episode. Occasionally some are not quite as funny, but those are usually the ones that are more sweet or trying to show saiki's good side
Overall: Must watch.",Positif
"Let me preface my review a little with a quick background story.
My first anime I've ever watched was Attack on Titan back when it aired in 2013. I was 10 at the time and I had to stop watching because it gave me nightmares ( don't laugh it was kinda scaring ). At the age of 10, I understood 2 things about anime, that it wasn't PBS' Cyberchase and I loved it.
Fast-forwarding to the summer of 2019, I stumble across AOT on Netflix and I fell down the anime whole once again. And after AOT guess what I watched? Saiki K
Now I'm telling you this
show makes me laugh CONSISTENTLY like I'm telling you this is the show you watch in the living room while eating dinner on a Friday night ( yeah I don't go out much but whatever shut up ). It never failed to make me laugh, or at least put a smile on my face, and that's exactly why its one of my favorite shows ever.
Plot:
The plot to Saiki K is focused around our physic pink-haired highschooler, who just wants everyone to STFU. He has a lovable personality and can easily be liked by any watcher. The show features him and his highschool friends going about in their daily lives and Saiki, unwillingly, stepping in to solve any upcoming problems.
Whether it is romance troubles, parents fighting, a cat stuck in between two buildings ( don't asl ), highschool bullies, or even a chain of events that somehow leads up to the damn school blowing up, Saiki is always there to save the day.
That's the very basic plot and if it sounds too causal or overdone to you, I want you to still give it a shot, it's easy to fly through a few episodes in a night and just chill. There's no need to sit around and feel overly stressed trying to connect plot points and predict future episodes because the best part about this show comes from its casual lightness and comedy. Damn it just watch a few episodes and see for yourself.
Characters :
I will say that the characters fall into the very generalized personality traits that you seem to find in ever anime. The pretty girl, the hard-working class rep, the ex-gang member trying to go good, the  -loveable- perv, the dumb one, the hopeless romantic, the one that literally delusional, etc etc etc.
Now when I say it's so easy to love these characters, I MEAN IT. I love absolutely every single one of them, and we see all these characters in different ways; how Saiki sees them, how the rest of the world/classmates/family sees them, and how they see themselves, thanks to Saiki's ability to read minds.
I find it both entertaining and funny to see each character's stream of consciousness in different scenarios, and how their internal feelings and perceptions contrast with how they act. There is character development in these characters, and I'm not talking Perfect Blue type development, but a more casual one that is more realistic to normal high school students.
As for Saiki, his ""please leave me alone"" and ""fine ill help"" personality is sooooo easy to love, and as a new viewer I found it easy to love him and his character development. When he finally acknowledges his friends as his real friends and not randoms in his main-character story, it's so heartwarming and satisfying to see
And I forgot to mention, every. single. character. is. HILARIOUS. just trust me on this one. HILARIOUS.
Art and Sound :
The art style isn't anything crazy impressive, however, I will like to highlight how refreshing it is to have the causally animated art style everyone once and a while. I'm a huge sucker for beautiful animation, I'm talking Garden of Words and Violet Evergarden type, but the animation of Saiki K is something I can really appreciate. It doesn't just ""do its job"", but you can tell it's well done and made with effort, the animation is clean and it deserves recognition for that.
For the sound, this is totally my opinion. but I don't watch dub. Like I watch sub for EVERY SINGLE SHOW. Now I'm not saying that dub is bad or whatever, but I personally can't watch an anime dubbed. The only reason why I bring this up is to point out that Saiki K is the only anime I've ever watched that I can watch in dub. I really don't know how to explain it, but the jokes flow way more than it does in the sub and the voice acting is damn near amazing. Like the little hint of attitude and stress doesn't feel forced or even like ""acting"" it feels real. Season 1 and 2 have sub on Netflix, but the rest is all in its original Japanese audio, which I don't mind at all.
Overall :
Just wanted to say thanks for getting this far I'm sure people won't read all of that but I absolutely love the show. Saiki K is probably the best comedy anime I've ever watched and is PAINFULLY underrated.
If you think this show is ""for children"", try again. This show can be enjoyed by anyone who just wants to have an easy to follow plot, loveable characters, and a casual laugh. Now I understand its a jump from ""heavier"" shows that are very plot and action-heavy, but Saiki K goes to show that you don't need crazy character development and a crazy plot to enjoy a show.
Everyone knows the struggles of high school, everyone gets a little annoyed, and everyone wants that group of friends you can always rely on, despite you're horrible attitude. We all have a little bit of Saiki in us and that's what makes this show so damn good.
WATCH. IT.     please <3",Positif
"it has been quite a long time since i have a blast watching an anime.
firstly and foremost, if you turned down by seeing its duration per episode, worry not!. Even though Saiki has an odd airing schedule (which is 4 minutes episode daily), every week they recap and release it to fully mainstream anime duration per-episode (which is around 24 minutes include OP-ED), so it is a decent show.
Saiki is your alternate saitama version with smarter plot and funnier gags. Every episode offer you the joy of watching this supposedly very unlucky boy handling his disastrous life, and from my experience watching this golden show
until the day i write this review, every episode is always better then the previous one. So its escalating ride of joy and fun.
well, you dont have to believe me obviously. Just download 1 episode and try it.
I highly recommended this ;D .",Positif
"Saiki Kusuo no Psi Nan is one of those comedies that is actually funny and not Japanese-funny. One of its strong points is that it uses a short chapter format with fast paced comedy, so there is rarely a dull filler moment. Most characters, while interesting, are ""stereotypes with a twist"", which might make some punchlines predictable. The humor of many chapters comes from the not-informed-by-the-narration fact that, although the main character appears serious and presents himself as a sort of voice of reason, he's actually kind of an idiot and does unexpected and ridiculous things with his powers. Has some nice world building that
makes everything that happens kind of make sense in the context of the series. It includes some subtle social critique in some skits, which I personally like.
Animation is nothing special, adequate for a comedy anime. Has very few off-model moments.",Positif
"I read the manga before watching the anime, and actually didn't realise the anime existed until I discovered it while I was scrolling through Netflix. I was sooo excited because I already found the manga to be the epitome of hilarity, and I was looking forward to watching the anime. And I must say, the anime was amazing. Great humour, lovable and memorable characters, short but interesting plot lines, what's not to love?
The main character Saiki Kusuo is a highschool boy with extraordinary psychic powers such as telepathy, telekinesis, teleportation, invisibility, shape shifting, psychometry, and much, much more (he's literally got, like, every power imaginable)
but he wants to lead a normal life. He finds his powers bothersome, and throwing in absurd characters such as Nendou (the idiot), Kaido (the chuunibyou) and Teruhashi (the pretty girl), his peaceful life is interrupted daily in absurd situations that are sure to make you laugh out loud. I loved Saiki's pragmatic responses to his companions' actions and the circumstances he finds himself in.
The anime was split into short parts that I felt was the perfect length as it kept the comedic plot lines simple but also effectively delivered the punchlines. The art wasn't perfect, but I almost didn't notice it because of the hilarious story. There were some parts of the manga that wasn't included in the anime, but I think the animation and voices and sound more than made up for it (I loved the little jazzy sound segues between each part!).
10/10 would recommend to anyone who loves pure, simple comedy. If you like a more complex plot line (ie. a main villain or troublesome situation that lasts more than a few episodes tops), I don't think this would be the one for you.",Positif
"This is easily the best shorts of all time for me. Whether you like serious anime or not, i would recommend you this comedy anime. It's a comedy/parody anime with a cynical and normal main character who spends his everyday life hanging out with extremely odd people.
The story doesn't really have any purpose, heck i would even say that there isn't one. Instead this anime showcases the extremely weird everyday life of the main character and how he spends it which is what makes it so nice to watch.
A very good thing is that the episodes do not end (almost always) randomly and
the next episode they suddenly go into a random place and time. There is an obvious timeline and you will not have to worry about what is going on or where they are. This is a common problem other shorter anime tend to have.
Another thing that might seem minor but actually increased the score for me is the world building. In some anime you only see the school and you kind of feel kind of shut in because of the lack of information outside of their school. In this anime they go to a lot of places and it feels like you understand how their city (including some other places) looks and it feels closer to you.
The art is above the usual because of how unique it is. The animation is pretty good and the designs are different. The songs and background music aren't anything special. However, the voice acting is perfectly done because everyone fits their respective roles and really expresses themselves perfectly. This is really important because this is the main reason why the comedy works very well. It would be pretty boring if they were emotionless.
The characters are all unique and have stupid traits which makes them likeable however extremely funny as well. There's multiple characters that fit every necessary comedic role to make every scene build up into the peak of your comedy explosion bar (the moment you'll start bursting out into laugh).
Another reason the characters (and the anime as well) is so likeable is because it's kind of long and you get to know the characters pretty well.
I guess it's time to talk about my laugh counter. Well, if you have seen and liked Gintama you should know that beating that anime is pretty hard. While it didn't do that it did certainly beat the average laughs per second compared to Gintama. This anime killed me inside a lot of times because of how genius it is with the comedy. It really understands what the anime industry needs and can feel the viewers.
Personally, i would recommend  that you should try out this anime as soon as you feel like it. The episodes are short so you can easily drop it if you don't like the type of comedy it offers. However if you do enjoy it you'll probably end up binging it. The great voice actors and unique characters are what makes this anime work as well as it did.",Positif
"OK, this movie is stunning enough to make me write a review for the first time. I just came back from watching it. It was a full house at the cinema. It is rare to see a full house in my country when the theater is airing anime. This was a total shock!
Story: 10/10
The story is great. It is sort of like a mixture of tragedy, comedy and romance. Its sort like the mixture of SAO, ALO and GGO but mainly it revives that kind of feeling after you watch the original SAO. It makes me feel nostalgic.
Art: 9/10
For me, the art can
be considered good enough and at certain parts the coloring is  mind blowing especially when they defeated the monster. The animation also looked more lively compared to the recent GGO series. A great improvement overall.
*Wagnaria Cafe (www working!) made a cameo !
Sound: 9/10
The OST is not as great as SAO, but they did use some of the SAO soundtrack (mainly Swordland) and even made an improved version for certain situation.
Character: 9/10
In Chinese philosophy, whenever there is Yin, there is always a Yang. But for this movie, they neutralize it perfectly. There is no real main evil guy here. All the character had been well design and created with lot of background information. (You can dig deeper to see how much they took into consideration before creating a new character such as Eiji) The MC, Yuna is so kawaii (you will know what I mean once you have watched the movie). A little bit fan service as usual between Asuna and Kirito.
Enjoyment: 10/10
I really enjoyed the 2 hours in the cinema and I do think that you probably need to watch the original SAO series first before watching this movie if possible try to finish ALO and GGO as well.
Overall: 9.4/10
Overall score is 9.4 but I will definitely round it off to 10 instead of 9 because of the story, the comedy, again Yuna is so kawaii, the art and coloring during the FIANL MOMENT when the monster is defeated and the BGM being played at the right time at the right moment. I would definitely recommend any SAO fans to watch it, you will never regret!
* For those who plan to go cinema and watch it, do stay until the ending song is finish. You will be rewarded :)
** Sorry for my poor grammar, do drop me a message if you found any grammar mistake that I had made.",Positif
"This was actually good, not disappointing I have to say...
Story: 7
The prologue isn't that good.. It starts off the end of their story. Which really doesn't give you any bad-thoughts such as someone dying or having the mood that it'll be like, meh.
You'll get to feel the tensity, but the answer to their ""plot's"" problem was obvious. But, I still like how they have a sad concept based on what it originally is. It brings everything back from the way it was like the SAO scenario.
And about Shino Asada. I liked the fact that she respected Kirito and Asuna as a couple even though she
had feelings for Kirito therefore not creating anymore further drama.
The villains are cliched. We have seen these type of villains many, many times before in the previous seasons of Sword Art Online.
Art/Animation: 9.5
Of course the art is beautiful and the animation is smooth. But if you look closely, you can see some parts where is a little bit off.. The animation's so good that it hurts my eyes...
Sound: 10
Binaural hearing's the best. I watched this movie at a cinema. You can hear everything so clear. ~Zoom~ fades~ Boosh~~~~~~~ And the bgm's really beautiful. The music's immersive.
Character: 7
Ah, still same old same old. I'm still annoyed how Kirito can do everything as long as he's serious. The girls are still after his *cough. The jokes they did weren't really that funny.. Kirito and Asuna still continues their boring relationship..
Enjoyment: 7
To be honest, I thought this was going to be disappointing. But once you've passed the prologue. It fills you with curiosity that makes you wanna know more and you really do want to check out those fighting scenes. The fighting scenes are great. There are just times you're like: ""They're winning, the enemy just doesn't know how to dodge."" Their jokes... 6.5/10
Seeing the old Kirito still kinda bores me...  There are some ""plot holes"" left for a lot of characters. With that problem, it doesn't really make up anything you feel for these characters who played in this movie. The drama is somewhat good for the last part.
Overall: 7
I just explained.. I know I'm not really good at explaining. But, I hope you'd understand. Their will to fight, their story, their past, their moments, are good. The ending left Kirito carrying some guilt. The antagonist(the one who fights) is retarded and is somewhat kind of fun to see him failed miserably...  As much as I go into detail, kiss scenes always get cock block...... Kirito is the king of ARMMORPG(may it be every game).",Positif
"The movie wasnt hype without a reason and boy did they delivered it. I really liked how the story went. I liked everything about it because the movie was that good. That 1 year waiting was so worth it and now after watching it I just wanna download it and watch it again and again! I've never felt so much enjoyment before even when I was watching Kimi No Na Wa. Sure that movie became a class of its own but SAO Ordinal Scale just went above that level. Its only been less than 24 hrs and it alr has a 8.57 rating. This may
well be the new best anime movie and possibly will remain as the best throughout 2017.
The nostalgic feeling when they changed into their old SAO outfits from SAO1 with Kirito having his dual swords, dressed in his iconic blackswordsman and Asuna in her iconic KOB outfit. Just amazing. They even added back Kirito's legendary Starburst stream and Yuki's 11combo hit on Asuna. The end battle was really exciting and I was filled with so much of nostalgic feelings.",Positif
"Great story, with EPIC/OP scenes, music from revious seasons included in movie, character development for the MC's. This is a must see for those who enjoyed the SAO anime. Also, there are a few scenes that you can understand the epicness only by having seen the 2 seasons of SAO.
For those who have seen SAO (and liked it), WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! Soo many scenes that relate to the previous SAO's. A big enjoyement, with Asuna and Kirito's relationship being important in the story. Great action scenes. Also, you re gonna get a lot of surprises while watching the movie, soo many that you re
gonna think ""That was soo Epic and Awesome!!!!"" I personally loved it, SAO being one of my favourite anime. I m soo glad to have watched it. Also, watch the movie until the very end, even after the credits. You re gonna get another good news.
For those who haven t seen SAO at all, you can still understand the story, but it's still better to have at least a bit of knowledge of what had happened during the previous seasons. Also, if you haven t seen the previous SAO's, you wouldn't understand why people find some scenes completely EPIC, even though it seems to be average to you. So, I think that it is better to have seen the previous SAO's, to be able to relate and enjoy the awsomeness.",Positif
"There will be PROBABLY SOME MINI MINI MINI SPOILERS HERE so I'll do my BEST NOT TO SHOW ANYTHING WHICH IS CONSIDERED A SPOILER.
For your __SAfety__, DON'T READ MY REVIEW YET UNTIL YOU WATCH THE MOVIE!
If you already watched the MOVIE, Feel Free to READ!
Sword art online: Ordinal Scale was everything i expected from the Sword Art Online Series and much much more well. And i know people will be wondering is it worth watching, YES!!! YES!!! YAAS!!! YES! IT IS THE BEST MOVIE! SWORD ART ONLINE IS BACK IN AN AWESOMELY GOOD WAY!!
If we're gonna get Sword Art Online Season 3
coming up this year and they're this good then im on board and I DIDNT EXPECT SUCH A WIDE ARRAY OF IMPRESSIVE THROWBACK AND MEMORIES of the past SAO 1 and 2 and Characters... I HAVE NO IDEA THAT WAS COMING! That i'll discuss later on...
Lets start with the story, <9/10>
The plot is really interesting and really entertaining. There're some jokes in there, mini interesting romances and GREAT CHEOGRAPHY FIGHTING! Comparing this and the old SAO episodes is that, the old SAO episodes have some errors that Itou, Tomohiko, the director have made, and I still think that this is a fun series, and THIS MOVIE! WOW! Itou has IMPROVED and THANK GOD HE and the ORIGINAL CREATOR,Kawahara, Reki KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING! I think they work together to produce this GREAT FILM!
Art <9/10>
Nice animation design! Actually this is the FIRST TIME THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH GREAT and SMOOTH ANIMATIONS! Which i've never seen before compared to other action or whatever animes. and YEAH! NOT BAD. Nagashima, Takayuki, Art director. Im not sure if i miss anymore staffs who are involved with this...
Sound <10/10>
I FKING LOVE THE THEME SONG! LiSA DID A GREAT JOB IN DOING THE THEME SONG ""Catching the moment""! LOVE THE THEME SONG! IT'S RIGHT NOW ONE OF MY FAVORITE THEME SONG EVER!  I WOULD LITERALLY LISTEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN! Kajiura, Yuki and Kanda, Sayaka, Congrates on doing the music and inserted song. And again! LOVE THE MUSIC! CONGRATES LiSA and the other music team!
Character <10/10>
NEW CHARACTERS, Eiji, Yuna and Shigemura. I would start individually on Eiji. Eiji was one of the Top 2 player and he really wants to show the other players who played SAO by comparing his playstyle 'AUGMA' and ""VRMMORPG"" to prove that he's the strong player.
Next is Yuna! Oh boy! THE DESIGN OF HER IS GREAT! I ALSO LIKE HER ANIMATION! And i like the way she show her PAST to kirito when she was in or the survivor of SAO DEATH GAME. BTW, Yuna looks kinda HOT!
Finally is Shigemura, well to be honest he has the same plan, PROBABLY or ALMOST like Kayaba..... Well he's okay!
OH WAIT!!! NOT DONE YET!!! There's ONE MISSING CHARACTER which the designers forgot to ADD HER! LEAFA aka SUGUHA! Yes! The movie has every character like Kirito, Asuna, Klein and others WEARING THE ""ORDINAL SCALE"" OUTFIT!! BUT FORGOT LEAFA!! COME ON!! ;-; I KNOW the movie wallpaper has SUGUHA WEARING THE ""ORDINAL SCALE"" OUTFIT BUT I DIDN'T SEE HER FIGHTING WITH HER ""ORDINAL SCALE"" OUTFIT! Without THAT THE MOVIE WOULD NOT BE COMPLETE!!!
Sorry guys, its just that im worried about missing SMALL PARTS from the movie!
Well I still give a 10/10
Overall -
Well, to be honest with myself THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE MOVIES OF ALL TIME! THE BEST PART I LIKED FROM THIS MOVIE IS ADDING THE THROWBACKS OF SAO 1 and 2, the OLD OUTFITS Kirito and the others wored, THEIR OLD PLAYSTYLE, MEMORIES from the series, and THE CHARACTERS FROM THE SERIES, such as FROM ALO FACTIONS,  Cait Siths,  Salamander factions,Sylph AND ALSO SOME CHARACTERS FROM GGO!
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, Yuuki Konno! I really wanna show some RESPECT to YUUKI because she.....you know..... passed away and that made me sad......and i literally nearly cried in the cinema when i see her popped out in the final battle!
THE THROWBACKS and the PAST SERIES ARE ADDED in the movie, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING and IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I GOT AND IT WORKS!
TO BE HONEST, THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST SHOCKING MOMENTS YOU EVER SEE IN THIS MOVIE and I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS WILL SHOW UP!!
WELL! SWORD ART ONLINE: ORDINAL SCALE ! ONE OF MY FAVOURITES MOVIES! GETS THE FINAL RATING OF..... 10/10 !!! CONGRATULATIONS TO THE STAFFS WHO PUT UP A LOT OF FREAKING EFFORT ON THIS SPECTACULAR MOVIE! AND I WOULD LOVE TO WATCH AGAIN so i can recall so.......
I HOPE SEASON 3 WILL BE GOOD. Speaking of SEASON 3, the aftercredits, PROBABLY ORDINAL SCALE MIGHT CONTINUE WITH SEASON 3.... I don't KNOW!!!
Now LETS WAIT FOR THE ENGLISH CAST/ DUB VERSION!!",Positif
"Hello SAO fans, haters and people alike, this a NON-SPOILER REVIEW of SAO: Ordinal Scale(so u know it came out earlier in my country and I just came out from watching it).
Before the actual review, I would like to emphasise a few of my concerns & ""wishes"" before I entered the cinema:
1. Make Kirito likeable-As an SAO fan(sorta), the one thing that tainted a bad image in my head for SAO besides the COUGH Fairy Dance arc COUGH...was Kirito; he lacked any REAL character development. To me, he was just 'there' to say for the plot to advance.
2. If Yui pulls a hax,
do it 'right'-A random thought circulating in my mind as I saw Yui in one of the trailers,""oh boy prepare for Yui-ex machina"". Being another thing I DISLIKE(not hate) about SAO, I was hoping at least it wasn't as jarring that affect the entire movie.
3. Be entertaining and 'GOOD'- This is not really a personal problem but more an optional one. One of the reasons I loved SAO how gawd damn entertaining it was MOST of the time(Fairy Dance arc I'm looking at you again). What I wanted A1 Pictures to do is to have a have line of merging entertainment and quality for Ordinal Scale.
So, what's my verdict? Well overall, surprisely...it was pretty good! But how may ask? Let me breakdown my opinion;
Story: The movie has very certain theme that I so happy that they address, for the longest time I thought Reki Kawahara would never address. Thankfully they did and it was handled pretty well in terms of SAO standards. Plotholes in the movies personally were minimal and you have to be an extremely nitpicky person to find them out and it really depends on your perception. Since this place between s2 and the next arc, it fits rather nicely and takes it back to its 'roots' to one thing that many thought SAO lacked later on, Tension. Thou not as SAO terrifying(for awhile until the BIGGER reveal popped up), it feels refreshing to see it back better than ever. The ""deus-ex-machina"" of the movie wasn't as bad I thought it was so that's a plus LOL.
Characters: Oh boy this movie pretty well on this department(a relieve for me honestly). I hear back months ago that an SAO movie is going to handle Kirito's and Asuna's relationship my inner critic mindset was fan-gasming to the core, ""ACTUAL CHARACTER FOR KIRITO!? F**K YES! Plz be gud thou."" Miraculously, thank the lord it was well done, for once in SAO history, I did feel emotions for Kirito at times I so glad this happened. For Asuna's case, her amazing character development from the Mother's Rosario is carried on strongly here and it's great when Kirito's and Asuna's relationship 'intertwine' to say. You can actually tell they humanly love each other no matter what they go through. Hell, even the left-out characters got their spotlights and I was smiling throughout those moments; maybe not for one character but hey THEY AIN'T LEFT IN THE TRASH AT LEAST. The new characters; how about them? Well for the most part, their pretty good in terms SAO. The character ""Eiji"" especially. At first, judging by his coincidental name I thought he was going an evil Kirito with the Edge meter cranked to the max but that was the case initially, my outlook of him did changed of him. He is one of the better SAO Villains and he isn't the real villain of the movie. The real villain unfortunately I am unable to give thoughts as it is rather spoiler heavy. As for another character, Yuna, she is too spoiler heavy not but not as much. She is like if Hatsune Miku and Yui had a child. The best part about her is spoiler heavy thou sorry.
Animation and sound: What can you say? It's A1 Pictures and it's SAO. Many people who hate the series do at least mentions the stellar animation it has and the movie is no different. Character modelings are on point, scenery is beyond gorgeous and extremely fluid animation and effects. Inconsistency in this category can be noticeable but it's nitpicky and rare. Voice acting is well done as well for both returning and new characters.
Verdict: All and all, in my opinion, 8.5/10. It safe to say that Reki Kawahara and A1 Pictures knew what they were doing. It wasn't a cash-grab movie, it was surprisingly well put movie with great character developments, moments; sure that could some weird things here that for me(which I explain in my spoiler review if you want me to) but ya, it's good(to me).
BTW IT IS MY OPINION PEOPLE SO YA.",Positif
"The Sword Art Online curse continues on the series but not on this one.
Story 7 - Somewhat predictable but the executions were good enough to make the story plot stand out. They really improved their writing and put it in a logical way. But the story is not perfect ofc but it is good, not mediocre, it's above average I would say.
Art 10 - On this one A-1 pictures animation is pretty massive. They used the Clean 2d animation with the mix of CGI effects and the  1st thing comes into your mind is the Ufotable Strategy. Big production right here, like having the
2d smoke mixed with translucent cgi smoke. Heavily filtered characters + the world building here is better than the series. Overall, astounding animation with stellar editing.
Sound 8 - A pretty good one but not so special, they able to capture the scenes with good soundtracks and overall a very decent Sound/Music.
Characters 7 - The main problem of this franchise is the cliche characters, It's OKAY to have cliche ones but please make use of your characters wise and important, the ""unbalanced characterization"" of SAO is a major major problem but here they kind of fix it but still more work/effort to go.
Enjoyment 10- I really really enjoyed this one :D I can't deny it bruh
Overall 8.4/ ( 8 / 10 )  despite of its problems / issues , they naturally stand out and made a better quality of the series to a movie. Goodsht A-1 pictures not so bad :))",Positif
"I'm not an avid fan of SAO nor do I despise the show however this movie was actually decent!
The Art and Sound were as expected of A1 and although the story and characterization weren't amazing for a movie it was actually enjoyable due to the simplistic plot that is engaging enough and fun to watch with an ample amount of action to distract from the lack of any coherent story.
All in all it isn't the next makoto shinkai master class but it's got good enough sound art and action to distract from the fact.
8/10 probably wouldn't watch again but the music (the OP
at least) will be listened to again... and again..and.....",Positif
"Just finished the movie half an hour ago; I'd like to write while my memory is still fresh.
I had watched the first season of SAO last year and it was, well, quite shit. Even though the concept had the potential to make the anime a masterpiece. The romance was flat, the story was a chockful of Deus Ex Machinas and the second arc was just plain bad. I decided not to watch SAO II, as I had read and heard that it was worse than the first season. But when the movie was primed to be released in my region, I just simply had to
watch it. It is an indescribable feeling that I guess most anime watchers have felt before: Is the movie going to be as average as the original anime adaptation? Is Ordinal Scale simply meant to be a cash grab, or is it going to be a genuine attempt at telling a good SAO story?
Sitting on the bus now with an SAO: OS promotional paper bag resting on my legs, my opinion stands is that it was a little bit of both.
Sword Art Online: Ordinal Scale was surprisingly good.
The film kicks off with the introduction of the somewhat new breakthrough in the gaming industry: the Augma. Compared to the NerveGear in the actual SAO arc and the AmuSphere in the other arcs, the Augma was not a VR device, but an AR device.
What is AR? Augmented Reality, or AR for short, is exactly what it sounds like. AR devices or games aim to capture virtuality in reality. A good example would be the recent hit phenomenon, Pokémon Go, a game which players try to catch virtual objects in the real world.
Ordinal Scale is an AR game on a massive scale. Players, who no longer have to lie in bed and enter semi-sleep just in order to experience a virtual world and its thrilling adventures, could now simply take their wireless Augma out with them, wear it as a piece of headgear and head to various locations in the real world to team up with friends to fight huge game bosses. Of course, rewards were given if each boss was successfully defeated, but the rewards were actually tangible things such as a coupon for a free beef bowl or free cakes at a restaurant. The Augma, however, was not only just capable of providing an all-new way to game, but also had messaging and health management functions. I bet if this was released in the real world, it would be a hit in no time.
Appearing before us is our originally overpowered MC Kirigaya ""Kirito"" Kazuto, who is caught along by the new wave of Augma fanaticism. Along with Asuna and his old friends from Aincrad, now dubbed the ""SAO survivors"", Kirito goes out into the real world to fight a boss, only to discover that the boss was an old level boss from Aincrad. Realising that he didn't have the weightlessness that he had in VR, Kirito, an unfit bastard, could not replicate his sheer game-breaking power he had in almost all the other VR worlds. In the midst battle, he meets the mysterious girl who appears to him repeatedly afterwards: a popular AI diva Yuna, who is basically something like a vocaloid with personality. He also has frequent encounters with the 2nd ranked OS player, Eij. As battle after battle rages, Kirito starts to feel something amiss after strange incidents occur and uncovers the conspiracy behind certain aspects of Ordinal Scale.
While it was somewhat refreshing to finally see Kirito so weak at his game for a short while, the story of SAO: OS was not too shabby. Unlike the anime arcs which had many gaps in both plot and timeline, the film is coherent and understandable. There are no longer any ambiguous character intentions (like Kayaba's reason to create Aincrad ¬_¬)  and the reasons behind every characters actions, no matter whether they were villains or the good guys, were presented clearly. The concept of Ordinal Scale and the marriage of the real and virtual world isn't anything new to the current era- but this isn't a bad thing. Instead, it helps us to enjoy the movie better because it relates to us here and now. Despite the fact that the movie is set on the 2020s, Augmented Reality (and Vocaloid idol fandom) is something that is widely talked about and enjoyed presently. The film opens our eyes to see how AR could be enjoyed close to the present; but truth be told, we do not have to wait long. Pokémon Go could have public events soon and players would be able to, as seen in the movie, take to the streets to catch legendary Pokémon. The future that SAO: OS shows us is not far after all and gives us many ideas and anticipations for what's to come in the near future. Aside from that, the movie makes several references to the anime which are pleasing to see. These reasons is why I enjoyed the story of the movie somewhat, despite it's occasional clichés and plot predictability.
In the animation department, A-1 Pictures delivers. SAO: OS deviates notably from crappy and sappy story for a more action-centred take on the SAO franchise. Animation is fluid, especially during the action scenes which are fast-paced and literally action-packed, but money didn't leak from the screen unlike films by CoMix and ufotable. A-1 had one job, and they did it. So there's no complaint for this section.
As for sound, I would say that this was one of the greater aspects of the film. You would do well to watch this film in cinemas; the surround sound was simply amazing. Along with great music, the background sound effects did an excellent job and immersed the audience in the action sequences. My seat literally shook when a game boss buried his weapon into the ground.
Speaking of music, Yuki Kajiura did a fantastic job. Her signature way of composing her music is apparent in countless areas in the movie, and tracks from the original OST such as Swordland (unfortunately, without the coffee and soda) were played, inducing a sense of unneeded but appreciated nostalgia. LiSA's theme song, ""Catch the Moment"", was the credits song for the film. Ironically, most fans who had left the cinema the moment the credits rolled failed to catch it.
Ha. Ha. Ha.
Now for the characters. Like I mentioned earlier, the characters, whether good or evil, had clear intentions behind their actions. Unfortunately, even so, I can't help but feel that the characters are bland. They don't actually really serve much of a purpose for the story, but it was still good to see (and relieving not to see) some of the old characters. I was so happy to see Klein receive just a little bit screentime and Suguha not to receive close to any at all with the excuse of being sent off to Kendo camp. She's the character I hate the most in the franchise; just plain obnoxious. Even Yui isn't that bad. Kirito and Asuna's relationship is also one of the apparent parts of the film, and unlike being such an odd couple in SAO, they actually behave like a mature couple. Although they ain't canonically 20 yet, they already seem like they're married. We also get to see how attached Asuna actually is to Kirito. Don't get too worried yet, it's still a healthy relationship that hasn't descended to yandereism yet.
All in all, I'll have to recommend Sword Art Online The Movie: Ordinal Scale. It was an unexpected enjoyment-it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and yet exceeds the expectations of an SAO hater like me. The SAO Movie is well-animated and has great sound and music. It provides a new outlook at possibilities of technology in the future, and yet provides a good story to go along with that. The plot is more than I have described, but I tried not to spoil anything at all, so if you are interested in the movie, please watch it at a local cinema near you. Sword Art Online is not leaving cinemas soon and is still being released in countries across the world, so fret not even if you are not able to watch it now.
If you do happen to get a ticket, just don't forget to stay for the after-credits scene!",Positif
"Alright, I'll keep this review clean and as spoiler-free as much as possible since I haven't really written any new reviews for the past two months.
To begin, I must say that Ordinal Scale actually went above my expectations. It simply went off with a large bang and it really kept me at my wits end.
Since we're talking about Kawahara Reki-sensei here, expect awesome twists that really connects along all the dots. The story focuses on Asuna and Kirito's current relationship and it tests that connection to their limits. If you think about it, it's somehow generic, but the story build-up is spectacular and it really
leaves you awe-inspired.
In terms of the sound, art, and animation, I have no qualms about that. A-1 Pictures really did a number on the art and especially the animation, and that mostly and definitely made me give the movie the praise it utterly deserves. The action or battle scenes are pretty much enough to make you say ""wow"" — I mean... you really gotta see those colors and distortion effects flying through the screen.
In terms of characters... I'm really glad to have seen Kirito and the gang again in action, also, don't forget the new characters because they also give a lot of meaning to the show. With the addition of these new characters, you can almost guess where the next story will lead you. Personally, I think that SAO is going to take a much, much darker turn.

My verdict: 10 out of 10
NOTE: Please watch the movie up until the end of the credits. There are extra scenes after the credit roll.

"Virtual reality goes into the Augmented Reality.
LA will be brutally honest with the Sword Art Online series, LA saw SAO go through ALOT of shit, from LA fairly liking the Aincrad arc, utterly hating how lazy the Alfheim arc was in how they pretty much flanderized MANY of the characters, then come Gun Gale and LA gave some ""liberties"" to it but saw some gaping plot holes and more of that flanderization showing from Alfhiem and finally comes Mother Rosario's arc where LA saw glimpses of good writing here and there but LA still wasn't convinced by the end of it that Sword Art Online
turned out to be mediocre, this wasn't helped by the fact that LA was naive and not as experienced in showing how LA really felt about anime at the time and LA joined in the hate train of fellow reviewers. Now however Sword Art Online as a franchise has been talked about even to this day, debated against as one of the worst animes in anime history merely because it's popular for newbies or popular in general.
With that last statement however is something LA will talk into detail a bit later, but for now, we're talking about the movie Ordinal Scale, so does it outdo the anime series or will having a ""movie-only"" character be it's biggest detriment to it all...well uhhh LA thinks this runs MUCH deeper than the excuses LA even talked about right now.
Be warned however LA will be going to spoilers with this movie.
Ordinal Scale's plot somewhat pays homages to it's previous arcs into something rather huge and with the obvious enhanced technology the SAO world in it's real world has progressed from VR to AR mirroring OUR real life gaming progress, the parallels of Pokemon GO is quite the obvious ones for world building for Ordinal Scale's in terms of one of it's plot set pieces of Raid Bosses in AR Real Life and it's Ranking Systems and in this little world building comes our main plot of a mysterious idol singer by the name of Yuna voiced by Sayaka Kanda helping with these Raid Bosses, however when Kirito's gang wants to participate, something else brews in the darkness of past that will haunt them.
Ok, first thing first to get through all this and the one that LA found to be the most implausible would be the entire fact of since this is AR and most of the ""actions"" they take would feel silly of the other people looking at the Raid Area let alone the AR allowing them to do feats they couldn't exactly do in real life at times, plus some of the destroyed terrain obviously wouldn't show up in the real world would be even weirder.
With LA's defense with this is that there can be a bit of implausibility to the story a ""suspension of disbelief"" as it were an escapism mindset for this kind fo series as it were and this one for LA's intention is warranted if only the only annoyance being Kirito is the skin we're wearing here.
One of the most known and earliest villains of this movie is Eiji Nichizawa voiced by Yoshio Inoue who is something of a contrast to Kirito if only in AR (as Kirito got into the fad late...he's a newbie at AR), he's also one of the driving forces of the plot as he interacts with the mysterious idol Yuna which makes him somewhat important early on and the thing is his motivations and belief about SAO is somewhat warranted to the point LA was rooting for him in some cases of this movie, that of Eiji wanting to erase ALL memory of SAO from ALL the survivors, to this LA says that YES this makes sense of a sympathetic villain wanting to right the wrongs even if his ways are somewhat reckless mercenary-styled ways of doing things.
Really the main villain pulling the strings to Ordinal Scale, Tetsuhiro Shigemura voiced by Takeshi Kaga does have a similar reasoning to his motivations however gets even more desperate to reach his goals than Eiji does and has an intrinsic link to Yuna, plot-wise.
With Yuna being a movie only character, yes it was inevitable as to what would happen to her like MANY movie-only characters that's been done time and again, but since the source material is there and her inevitable outcome would be, LA actually likes how they handled her for the most part.
In terms of animation by A1-Pictures, A1-Pictures went all out with this movie, by giving us vibrant coloring and backgrounding and an utterly amazing battle choreography. What can LA say but the animation from the crisp character designs, amazing battles and choreography let alone one of the best fights shown near the end of the movie and beautiful backgrounding, A1-Picture really outdid themselves with Ordinal Scale.
In terms of voice acting, LA would say that the voice acting was great overall with most of the voice actors reprising their roles from the anime series, with special MVP to Haruka Tomatsu as Asuna and Sayaka Kanda as Yuna in which Sayaka Kanda is an actual singer which has it's added benefits when her character is an idol. Thankfully for Ordinal Scale, they gave the rest of the harem as well as minor characters not only from the movie but the entire span of 2 seasons of living characters some screentime, the voice cast is massively impressive even with their somewhat limited screentime anyways. (LA is mostly saying this because of Miyuki Sawashiro as Shino)
If there was anything LA Ordinal Scale was saying to LA the loudest wasn't Kirito or Asuna's relationship, trying to world build as much as possible or show how cool AR is (and how extreme this would be in actual real life), no if anything LA saw Ordinal Scale as a sincere apology letter for what it did in Alfhiem's arc. In a ways the main villain's goal of erasing all the memory of SAO was pretty much Ordinal Scale saying sorry for it's lazy writing and with Eiji and Shigemura being the extremes of this analogy in erasing ALL the bad deeds SAO did, Kirito, Asuna and Yuna are the ones saying, not ALL of it was SAO's faults and problems and erasing everything makes it pointless.
LA is getting somewhere with this analogy and to that it's yes, Sword Art Online is mainstream popular and because it's popular many people bash it, or love it, it's divisive as possible even now. But is it the worst anime ever made, pfffffttt are you kidding LA?, this is hardly the worst anime franchise let alone series, anime as a medium has churned out for itself, so what if SAO has gaping holes in it's plot, doesn't makes any sense of one huge fault leads it to be the worst anime ever. If there was one little belief LA had about the SAO franchise as a whole by the end of it's second season run is that, yes it had it's major problems but LA cannot for the life of LA say it's the worst anime ever made...seriously you NEED TO LOOK DEEP in finding the worst and SAO being the target of being extremely popular backfired on some people because of one little fault and made it the worst?...it's insane what kind of logic it turned into and guess what LA had that mindset long ago, but now...it's mediocre at best nothing too horrible but nothing too great either, SAO for the anime community changed for both the better and worse and to that that's ok to LA, it got anime exposure and helped gather more fans of anime together. If there was one little thing wrong with every anime ever, anime let alone media in general wouldn't be booming as it is now, so crying foul over one petty fault is just sounding pretentious, entitled and annoying for the sake of ""being popular must be punished""...LA just finds this mentality baffling, if you like it, you like, be it ironically or not, if you don't...you don't. Yeah fine call LA a hypocrite for giving SAO's first season a 4 and LA's second season a 6, but is it worth a 1 for the sake of it being overly popular and that LA found Alfhiem and Gun Gale to be subpar?...well uhhh one, being overly popular doesn't even factor into it for LA so LA wouldn't do it in the first place and with Arc Fatigue of Alfheim and Gun Gale, LA can point out the faults of any anime like everyone else and put that into consideration like anyone else would but LA would not go to the point of condemning the series because of it.
This is what LA sees Kirito, Asuna and Yuna's belief about the ""memory of SAO"" to be, sure it had it's faults but is it to the point of erasing ALL of it...well then we wouldn't have Kirito and Asuna's relationship grow in Ordinal Scale and have some level of tension with Kirito wanting to bring Asuna's SAO's memories back (both the bad and good of it), hell without the memory of SAO, Asuna and Kirito's relationship would die out, so yeah Kirito has a reason to fight this time.
And to reiterate LA's point of LA's nitpick about Ordinal Scale's AR being implausible or ""wrongly done in real life"", no LA would not condemn Ordinal Scale because it wasn't ""realistic enough"". Ordinal Scale if anything gave us lots of world building of Sword Art Online through it's technology, gave us lots of character interactions and lots of growth to Kirito and Asuna's character individually by it's plot structure and growing relationship, the villains have legitimate purpose in the plot and aren't half-baked villains, they for one contrast Kirito back in his SAO days and two they are sympathetic just with the wrong methods. Heck they even did the entire ""movie-only"" character right without LA being annoyed this time.
Ordinal Scale for LA only now has shown that Sword Art Online as battered and bruised the franchise has turned into can swing back and give us, no convince us that it's trying to pardon it's wrongs and it did it amazingly even if Ordinal Scale itself as a movie has it's own problems which can be for LA be given grace for a pretty good solid story, growing cast of characters and gorgeously and amazing animation to it all.",Positif
"I love SAO!!!! Haters, mind your own business. The series were worth watching and enjoyable at the same time. Both Season 1 and 2 are pretty good but the second half of the second season left me with a disappointment. Then this movie came along.....
My favorite arc of the SAO series!!! Everything is almost perfect. The action scenes, animation and story is awesome!!! This is best arc so far. The MC (Kirito and Asuna) are pretty well developed in the story. Side characters like Sinon and Klein didn't have enough screentime but the last scene gave them a little spotlight. The final battle gave me
goosebumps. The villain is pretty awesome too, much like Kirito in swords fighting.
The animation of the movie is amazing. I haven't seen anything like SAO's animation, one of the best IMO. The sound was not too good. I hear echo sounds during fight scenes (haven't watch this on theaters when it was showing, I have a copy of Blu-Ray).
Season 3 can't wait!!!!

Kirito is not OP in the beginning of the movie......",Positif
"Do you recall how you felt when the Sword Art Online series first begin to air? That fascination you had towards the entire concept of being trapped within a virtual reality; where death in the virtual world meant death in reality as well? Where you got to experience that unique sense of adventure, romance, and fantasy? If you do; then be well prepared to have this movie, Sword Art Online: OS, reintroduce that long-lost feeling to you.
As a fair prerequisite to this review I'll note that I watched this movie last night in the theater during the special ""One Night Only!"" showing promotion that seems
to be the standard for most anime movies in the U.S. So, my opinions and feelings about the movie as a whole are still quite fresh.
I came to write this review with two intentions: to give my honest thoughts on the movie and to detail my feelings about such; but also to make sure the all too prevalent incentive to knock down the S.A.O series doesn't misconstrue the reviews and/or depictions of this movie.
To begin this review it'd be best for me to give my honest opinion: I thought this movie was really ""cool,"" for lack of a better term. It's a movie which invokes the giddy young-child-esque feeling inside of you; the same feeling we all had with the start of the original Sword Art Online series.
In the theater I had two young children behind me who couldn't help themselves; they talked constantly and were clearly excited. In most situations this would be an offensive gesture; but to better clarify the feeling this movie evoked I couldn't help but relate to their youth-bound wonder and almost wanted to join in on the conversation.
The Sword Art Online Movie: OS almost seems to be a culmination of everything people have asked for from the S.A.O series. It's a production which I would imagine would occur if the studio looked at a S.A.O forum; read everything the audience said they wanted to see from the series, and then created a movie with those thoughts in mind.
The art and sound for the movie were very, very well done. The animation was clearly top-notch and the sound was something that not only fit the fight scenes very well (given their general context of a fantasy setting), but also sounded very impressive in the surround-sound theater. The only complaint I had with the art and sound were that the background characters (such as people walking in the background) were done through CGI, or an animation style that didn't seem to fit the animation style of the lead characters, but this wasn't enough to knock down my overall opinion of the art.
The story was an interesting one; and made for a story which felt worth following. It wasn't, in my opinion, the high point of the movie; but it also didn't hold it back. In my opinion the overall aesthetic of the movie, the absolutely amazing fight scenes, and the presence of everything a S.A.O fan could ask for was the reason to see the movie; more so than the presented story-line.
The characters I don't feel I need to detail, as we likely already know them well and it wouldn't serve me much to review them. However with that in mind this movie almost requires that you've prior seen the Sword Art Online series; otherwise a lot of it will not make sense. Before watching this movie I strongly recommend you watch through the first three season of S.A.O, so that any references and/or other points in the movie won't be overlooked due to lack of prior knowledge.
This movie is simply, in my best means of describing it: fun and exciting. If you watched S.A.O and ever thought ""I wonder ---"" then that wonder may be well fulfilled in this movie. There's a sense of realism in the movie that I've not seen in many animes; there's a clear respect for the wants of the fans, and whilst there were plot holes and other elements which could be negatively focused on; I don't think they did much to make the movie any less enjoyable. The same way you can take almost any series and focus on the negatives to make it a ""bad"" series, you can do to S.A.O - the problem being people have picked out S.A.O as one of the series that is common place to only look at in a negative light. This is why I wanted to write this review; I don't want this movie to be criticized to the bone like all other seasons of S.A.O have; I wanted to stand up and let anime fans know : If you like S.A.O, then this movie is, without a doubt in my mind, something you should see.
Enjoy your time at the movies! (Or on your couch at home watching the Blu-ray / DVD)",Positif
"[I will be referencing a few other anime; they might be not on the same level as SAO and that depends on your own perspective of SAO and the other animes. I’m not saying that they are as same as SAO nor SAO OS copying them, it’s just in my opinion that OS reminds me of them. Forgive me as I like to reference. Speaking of which, Wagnaria Café from WWW.Working! cameos in the movie.]
[I will not be talking about the characters as it will causes me to spoil everything from the movie]
Ordinal Scale starts off explaining briefly
about the Sword Art Online (SAO) anime-verse, it helps a little bit for the people who never had watched SAO. It shows some parts from the first season; Aincrad Arc, Fairy Dance Arc and second season; Phantom Bullet Arc, Calibre Arc and Mother’s Rosario Arc. After that, it went to the main focus of the movie; Augmented Reality (AR) with the help of the Augma device, the headphone-like device that is worn on the left ear that bridges the user to the virtual projected world. By that, users are still in the Real World yet connected to the digital grid that is AR. It is further explained in the movie.
OS is not plot heavy; instead it focuses more to action. And believe me; watching the fight scenes almost makes me feel on the edge of my seat. The movie starts off slow but it gets even faster and even more until it reaches its peak and then slows down until the end. Don’t worry; there is breathing room in between the action. The story is not all over the place and frankly, better than any Arcs in the anime in my opinion. I’ll admit that there are plot holes and a few things that seem very lacklustre on the story. But I’m not watching this movie because only of the story, I watch it for my enjoyment.
Let’s talk about the quality of the animation shall we? I’ve seen [Your Name (Kimi no Nawa)] before and it was a beautiful movie in its own right. But Ordinal Scale, an action packed Anime made by A-1 Pictures? It looks very stunning and lively! Fight scenes looks very aggressive. The colours are vivid and it also captures the emotion of the movie. Visually, it feels like you’re there with them without the need for 3D glasses or AR (insert topical joke)!
Next up, I will be talking about the soundtrack for OS. Yuki Kajiura, the person who made the soundtrack for the SAO anime, and also [Puella Magi Madoka Magica (Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica)] (Yes, that anime about magical girls bounded by a contract for the exchange of their desires) and countless others that I don’t know of her involvement. I swear she could have been listening to the OST of Madoka Magica and then tried to combine them with the OST of SAO while making the soundtracks for OS; I could definitely feel the tone and atmosphere of those pieces. Listening to Delete, made the strands of hair on my body erect and chilling my spine because it reminds me of memories from Madoka Magica. While listening to Longing reminds me of Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works. Basically, it’s great.
Watching this, it will make you think,” Is VR or AR really needed in this world of ours? Does it not separate us between the Reality and the Virtual but yet combines both into a blurry mess?” I admit it does have its own good, to an extent. But it also brings repercussions. Technology is a dangerous thing if it’s not used for the benefit of everyone.
I strongly believe this is the anime and movie for all SAO fans. The enjoyment value of the movie is over the roof.
*Note to everyone who have not watched OS or will be watching it soon; please, stay until the end credits. Sit down and wait and you’ll understand why I ask you to do so.",Positif
"so here i am loving this movie after i just watched it...i hated SAO's s2 really...it was a huge mess in my opinion...after i watched s1 i was in love with the series so much that i couldn't believe what i'm watching in the middle of SAO's s2 :(

if you're like me(i hated sao after s2)this movie will change your mind hopefully :D it did for me :)",Positif
"Let me frame this review before dropping into it full-throttle.  I had never seen any Sword Art Online until tonight.  I was invited to the March 9 one-showing select theaters event by a co-worker and decided to accept.  That being said, I obviously ""know"" SAO and its infamous polarized reputation (what anime fan in the past five years hasn't?).  I have seen enough reviews, reactions, and analytical diatribes to know the gist of the first season of SAO.  I have not watched any reviews or material about Gun Gale Online (SAO II) and only know smattering of what takes place.
That being said, I fully understood this movie and believe only first season knowledge is required to fully ""get"" it.
The story begins after the events of SAO II in the year 2026 (a few months after Gun Gale).  A new creation known as the Augmented Reality device (AR) has been released on the market and is all the rage with the general population in Japan.  Many have adopted the AR for exercise purposes and its enhancement to general daily living.  Gamers have begun to leave the total-emersion VR games of ALfheim and Gun Gale in droves to pursue the Augma, as it melds virtual reality in a stunning new way by allowing you to see digital imaging in the real world.  Players have become immersed in the freshly-released Ordinal Scale game on the AR and are all engaging in the new global ranking system in order to reach the top of the charts in their play skill.  Kirito, Asuna, and company are once again thrown into a new system that is advertised to avoid the dangers and not repeat the tragedy of the original SAO server world: Aincrad.  However, we all know this is not the case and soon strange things start happening to SAO veterans and survivors in OS after bosses from the original Aincrad server start appearing in the new game at special location events.
The characters of this anime are good, but basic with nothing to make them stand out amongst other shōnen anime.  Kirito has become ""out of touch"" with the latest and greatest regarding Ordinal Scale and ultimately has to regain his mojo once again as the story goes on forcing him to adapt to the new game format.  His relationship with Asuna has grown deeper in real life, but the duo still spend time at their ALfheim home when they aren't engaged in the new AR tech.  The rest of the characters are returnees from SAO including their fairy AI ""daughter"" Yui.  As a fan, I'm sure the weight of connection would have been greater if I had seen these characters throughout the progressing episodes, but for what it was, I can tell why fans have gotten attached to the OP Kirito and his company.  They aren't bad, but you could copy and paste most of them into other troupe characters we've all seen before.
The sound and art of the film was good and standard fare for the enhanced budget I'm sure the movie was given.  Seeing it in a theater didn't hurt the ""epic"" nature of the effects either.
All in all, my personal enjoyment of the film was a standard ""good.""  I'm kind of glad I was able to see this first after these last five years of hearing nothing but ultra-love/hate for this anime.  It was just fair at best.  I enjoyed my time and may actually watch the show.  Was the plot or characters stand-out among the anime I've seen?  No, not really....but that doesn't mean you can't have a good time with this.  Sure it's not a masterpiece, but it definitely isn't the lowest-most trash it is made out to be by some otakus.  Take it as you will, but this film was a simple, fun romp.",Positif
"I love this movie; I have to say it’s one of my favourite Anime movies. With awesome fight scenes, heavy drama and incredibly music. All of the characters have amazing interactions and the animation is incredibly fluid.
Story – 9
The story brings a new threat that hasn’t been experienced in the Sword Art Online universe. The idea of bringing the VR world to real life works incredibly. There are many heavy moments that put relationships and friendships on the edge. Reki Kawahara’s original story is amazing and brings a new element to the characters lives.
Art – 10
This is some of the best animation I’ve seen
from A-1 Pictures. From how fluid the animation is it’s easy to tell how much effort and love went into this project. The fight scenes are amazing and have some of the best choreography I have seen.
Sound – 8
I enjoy the J-pop made by Yunna just for this movie. The music brings immense detail to the story and allows the audience to truly immerse in the story.
Character – 9
All of the original characters are here from Season I & II, but Kirito and Asuna’s relationship is put on the line during the movie. The original side characters are here, but there is some more tension that is built throughout the story.
Yuuna is a great addition to the story and helps to guide Kirito throughout the story.
The villain is a very good and can be emotionally connected to by everyone.
The interactions between the main characters are great and so are the villains.
Overall – 9
I love this movie and can be picked up even if you haven’t seen any Sword Art Online. The Characters are great, the animation is great and the story is great.
Overall I have very little to hate on this film.",Positif
"This is my first review but I felt like it should be on this movie. I know I’m behind and it’s been out for awhile but been busy with work and school and really wanted to relax one day and enjoy it. This movie was absolutely amazing the story was great, the fights were great and the Asuna and Kirito moments were great too. This movie was amazing! If I could recommend one anime movie to someone it would definitely be this one. Recaptured the enjoyment I got from the first season of SAO. I have started to watch the new SAO series because of
this movie. I 100% recommend watching this movie. Hope you enjoy!",Positif
"I'll try to be direct and straight to the point
Story: 7
The story itself was good, it was easy to understand where they came from, what happened, the reason behind the actions and seemed to have a straight forward story line. The problem was that they had all the essential content and characters to make a great story, instead they rushed a few parts that they could've extended (such as the boss fights, interaction with other relevant secondary characters) but instead emphasized in other not so important.
Art/Animation: 10
The art and animation compared with the anime was a huge step up! Everything was smooth, vibrant
colors, detail was fantastic, and the fight scenes effects... just WOW...
Sound: 10
The OST (original sound track) fit great with the scenes, more upbeat and intense, sometimes even nostalgic due to the comeback of some SAO themed soundtracks.
Character: 9
I'm giving a 9 not because of the character development of Kirito and Asuna (which we already know, they simply emphasized more the aspects of them) but mainly for the new characters: Eiji, Yuuna and Tetsuhiro.
The significance and synergy  that those 3 characters had in the story was powerfull! They had a reason, an objective, and you only learn about it the more you get to the end which leaves you waiting for more. Not to mention the familiar faces (which I wont spoil), specially of a certain character in SAO II which almost drove me to tears.
As for Agil (the merchant in the first SAO, owner of the ""Dicey Cafe"", the black dude) I still feel he should have more lines in the story, seems just like a extra...
Enjoyment: 10
Watched the movie in the US release with the theater completely full of people who loved the series, and it felt fantastic. Everyone was hyped, laugh together and were pumped with the fights! Like i said there were some parts that felt rushed, others seemed to have too much screen time when it wasn't needed. But overall I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to watch it again, right as the movie ended.
Overal: 9
Although the story wasn't EPIC, the new comers absolutely kept things fresh and interesting, which end up making the main characters progression interesting. The animation was beautifully done and on point, the Sound was incredible (specially in the movie theater) even gave me the chills in some fight scenes, the level of fan service was kept low (which is a good thing) and whenever it was used, it was in either a comedic or dramatic scene which was good.
The best part of the movie is without a doubt the FINAL FIGHT, my emotions were all over the place, it was possibly one of the most beautifully done tribute to the franchise and to the fans. I do recommend anyone to watch it, in case you don't find it interesting, just watch until the end.
Better yet, watch first SAO, and SAO II so you have it fresh in your head, and then watch the Movie.
Cherry on top the cake*",Positif
"Reviewers point of view: There are many anime that I don't watch for plot purposes simply to avoid pure disappointment. The SAO series and movies are in that category. I don't read any of the light novels or manga and watch the series solely for the fight scenes and animation.
>I put spoiler footnotes at the bottom for those who already saw the movie<
Story: Watching this movie made me desperately desire a stamp (like the ones at the libraries) that can stamp the words ""utter bullsh*t"" on this whole plot. And I metaphorically pulled this ""stamp"" out about...9 times. The conflict
of the story was drastic and unnecessarily extreme. The goal the main antagonist was fighting for could've been easily achieved without using all the time, money, and effort that went into things (spoiler footnote #1). There also were ACTUAL parts or facts that the movie stated that contradicted facts stated in the previous anime!!!(spoiler footnote #2) It was hard to for me to empathize with the struggles when they could've been easily avoided. What I find quite ironic, I still think it's the best SAO anime to come out so far.
Art: The art as usual is beautiful and eye-catching. I enjoyed how the fights were choreographed and how the idea of the Augma and Ordinal Scale game were animated. The only complaint I might have is that the final battle wasn't as dramatic or intense as the ones before it which left me with this anti-climatic feeling.
Sound: The soundtrack carried over a few iconic songs of the series which I liked. However there were quite a number of songs sung by Yuna, Ordinal Scale's mascot-like idol/diva. Out of all the songs she sung, I can only remember one I actually liked (spoiler footnote #3)
New Characters: I was left disappointed when it came to the characters. First up: the new characters. The movie references to SAO's 1st season a lot (almost the whole movie). I already sorted out my feelings toward that season and moved on. However the movie attempted to add new, important characters into SAO's former plot. They were never mentioned nor referenced and thus were only put there for the sake of this movie and that made me feel apathetic towards them. (Spoiler footnote #4) This isn't a big deal, but I wish they did what they did with GGO where the antagonist was somebody Kirito met before.
Recurring Characters:The lack of character development was disappointing. You still have the the only two male recurring characters (Agil and Klein) who were MIA a majority of the movie. You still have Silica who still sucks at gaming and just ends up in the heat of battle doing nothing but screaming and waving a weak knife.You still have the inconsistent character of Asuna, where she's sometimes an independent female gamer bad***, sometimes a problematic ""housewife"" dependent on her lover, and the rest of the time when she's in the middle (basically commentating the battle until the boss is barely alive and she takes the final blow after doing NO WORK!!!).
Kirito: I saw a hope for improvement when I learned that Kirito is new and inexperienced in Ordinal Scale (since the main issue people had with him was him being overpowered). However, that hope dissipated when he somehow managed to become one of the top players in a WHOLE DAY!!! He literally ran around the city fighting bosses and ranking up without getting the least bit tired. (Spoiler footnote #5). For those who told me it was due to the adrenaline he had from Asuna's condition, I metaphorically stamp ""utter bullsh*t"" on your logic. XD
Enjoyment: It's pretty clear that I did not enjoy this movie. I had so many issues to point out and the only way I'd get them all in is if I were Cinema Sins (Footnote #6). Sadly, this IS the best SAO anime I've seen thus far. XD XD
SPOILER FOOTNOTES:
1. Did it TRULY have to be SAO survivors? Shigemura was truly prepared to do anything for Yuna and if that's the case, would have gotten a more accurate AI of her personality if he gathered his info from the memories of people who knew her best (friends and family) rather than the collection of SAO survivors who saw her as ""that singer I may have talked to on the lower floors"". It's clear that even without the memories, the bond remains and compare the quota the few who know her best to thousands.
2. Wasn't the 100th floor boss supposed to be Akihiko Kayaba? He was supposed to help the players and then make the big reveal when they reached the top.
3. That's a shame considering Yuna was an important part of the plot. I didn't even like her last song.
4. I refer to Yuna. The whole ""she was there and important the whole time and we didn't notice"" cliche? Really?
5. By the time Kirito and Eiji finally fought I was rooting for Eiji who actually abandoned his previous weak will and worked his way to the top possible player.
6. Cinema SIns: A popular Youtube channel that's known for going through movies cut-by-cut exposing plot holes and actions that made no sense.",Positif
"If you're a fan of SAO, please do yourself a favour and catch the movie in theatres. The action-packed animation film definitely looks better on the big cinema screen than your home theatre system and the sound effects, especially at the start when my chairs LITERALLY shook from the rumbling though it was not overly loud, really makes it worth the while!
*SPOILER ALERT* Review contains spoilers
SAO is all about an innovative game and virtual world so obviously some plots in the story may seem familiar but the overall character and story development did not disappoint! It really had a good mix of action-packed, romance, slice
of life, humour and touching sad scenes (the kind that may result in a tearful tug at the heart, not the all-out bawling heart-breaking drama type).
The story doesn't also shows Kirito in a different light, making it clear that RL Kirito may have spent 2.5yrs living a life of a hero, but may not naturally behave like one when he's back in the real world. (Pls trace back to characters' background in SAO series to understand the characters better, if you have not).
A teeny weeny bit disappointed by the imba god-like ulti swing of the all-mighty sword to clear the entire place. Like, seriously?! But I get how the movie _had_ to end already because of time (and probably budget) constraint.
Still, I really enjoyed this movie and wouldn't mind re-watching it again because it was that enjoyable!
4.5/5",Positif
"Part action,part romance,thriller and part Black Mirror this original story set in the world of the light novel/anime franchise titled Sword Art Online.
The villain is not one-note like what you have seen in the past and how the plot kicks in is both unexpected and gives an anti-hero vibe.
Great action scenes done by various studios beside A-1 Pictures such as MAPPA (Yuri on Ice,Punchline,Rage of Bahamut fame) and P.A Works (Angel Beats!), A story both embracing and warning of the dangers of what while is unlikely could happen to such technology and with themes about PTSD/dementia.
Fan service while in it was only minor compared to
even other Shounnen films such as Fairy Tail Dragon Cry and the show itself.
I found SAO to be a mixed bag arc wise but this film is just a fun time to both watch as a story and just as an action flick. This is likely A-1 Pictures masterpiece.
Also stay for the post-credit scene.",Positif
"Sword Art Online has came a very long way and it's finally time to write my review for it.
Sword Art Online itself deserves a rate of 8 or 9. Not because it's the very first anime I've ever watched and because it got be into anime. But because it has meaning into it and it really touches your heart whenever you watch it. But time for the review for Ordinal Scale
Story:9-10 The story was amazing. It's easy to understand, enjoyable, meaningful, and more. The story is about a Augmented Reality game where you got to fight bosses and level up. But here's where the story
gets interesting, any SAO player who died in the battle loses all memory they had in SAO. That's where our hero Kirito steps in tries to retrieve all the lost memory and give it back to the players. The story gets you into a very powerful and emotional state where you can't hold back and say ""What a beautiful movie I just watched.""
Art:10 Holy Cow! The new animation style really got me and I thought it was an amazing change to the SAO series. Can't lie though, Asuna just got 100x hotter like ain't she hot enough already? All the characters look 100x cooler and this is the type of animation style I like. The art definitely gets a rating of 10
Sound:8 What can I say about the sound? I really don't see the point of rating the sound I mean... It's the sound of swords, guns, bosses roaring, all the characters beautiful voice, and more. just ignore the sound part of this review.
Character:9 Like I said in the art, all the characters got a huge change because of the new animation style (Which I really love). The only thing I can say without having to spoil anything is Kirito just got a lot more lazier and Asuna and the other just feel more alive as ever.
Enjoyment9 I saw the movie at the English Premier and OMG I enjoyed this movie so much. I wanted to watch the movie over and over again. I know you will enjoy movie so I highly recommend watching if you haven't already.
Overall I think you should watch the movie if you haven't. It really catching your heart and there are so many new things we have learned about SAO in this movie. So many surprises and more! I highly recommend this anime!",Positif
"I am by no means what you would call a big fan of the franchise. I have never read the original Light Novels nor have I ever played any of the games. I haven’t even bought any merchandise (…aside from a couple of figures). I have only watched the original two anime seasons. They were entertaining, serviceable shows with fun characters, sweet moments, cool concepts, interesting worlds and great action. I had no big issues with it. At least, not any that would warrant me trying to crucify the series and burn it at the stake. As much as I liked it, I never really
did get into it and I never latched on to any of the characters except for maybe Sinon and Yuuki. (I’m sorry, but Sinon’s waist is a thing of beauty. Yes, I have a thing for shapely waists, but I digress.)
So, being neither a big fan nor a hater, I went into this movie with zero expectations, like I try to do for all movies. And as it turned out, even for a person like me with hardly any attachment to the series… I had an absolute blast! (^o^) After a dearth of anime movie sequels that actually succeeded in being little more than hollow, nostalgia-bait projects, it was refreshing to see that this movie does pretty much everything right… in my opinion, of course. Let me substantiate that.
WARNING! Spoilers ahead!
Just like Yu-Gi-Oh!, this movie was an original story and a direct sequel to the previous installment. However, unlike Yu-Gi-Oh!, this movie was able to cleverly incorporate fanservice elements (the non-erotic kind) without making them feel unnatural or contrived. Not only that, it was able to have a surprisingly tight plot that was self-contained. But it also drew enough references to the original to make it a proper continuation. Everything was cohesive and everything fit together well.
Starting off with the themes of the story, the main premise in this movie is the advent of AR technology and its increase in popularity over the “traditional” VR technology (as ironic as that might sound). In addition to the relevance of the discourse, the ideas and discussions it generated in the movie were thought-provoking, to say the least. While nothing revolutionary if you’ve seen Evangelion, Ghost in the Shell or Serial Experiments Lain, it was enjoyable to see the characters grapple with existential issues that ranged from how the self is defined, how memories relate to reality and how one handles trauma and loss. The dangers of AR were also critiqued with regard to the blending of the virtual and the real and it was nice to see that they acknowledged that both types of technology came with their own pros and cons.
Kirito’s hesitation to embrace the AR technology felt really on point and it was great to see him take time to adjust to the very physical nature of the new AR game. On a side note, I really loved how they portrayed the AR interface. I particularly loved the little notifications that popped up that were used to comic effect.
Regarding the plot, very basically, Kayaba Akihiko’s professor, Dr. Shigemura, the developer for the new AR headset and Ordinal Scale AR game in the movie, gave his daughter, Yuna, a NerveGear headset. She died in the game and he holds himself responsible for his daughter’s death. Through the AR headset and game, he plans to trigger traumatic memories in the surviving SAO players to “steal” them (more accurately, the memory scanning process makes it impossible for them to recover naturally). From the memories that players have of his daughter in the game, he hopes to reconstruct Yuna as an AI. Eiji, former Knights of the Blood guild member, Dr. Shigemura’s accomplice and Yuna’s friend during their time in SAO, also feels regret for not being able to overcome his own fear of death and his failure to save Yuna in the game because of it. He carries around a book memorializing the SAO incident that fails to mention him due to his cowardice.
The reasons this story works is because of how well everything fits together thematically. First and foremost, Dr. Shigemura and Eiji’s motivation is personal, believable and compelling. In addition, Dr. Shigemura’s plan is tragically ironic as it parallels Kayaba Akihiko’s own, the very plan that stole his daughter away from him. Another parallel can be drawn between his predicament and the predicament of our main characters, bringing us back to the themes of the self, memories, reality and trauma. Dr. Shigemura and Eiji are trying to deal with the trauma of losing Yuna to SAO while the other characters are dealing with the trauma of their past experiences in SAO. How should one deal with trauma? Do memories make the person? Some of the SAO survivors think it is better to forget the past, while Dr. Shigemura is unable to let go of his.
It hits close to home and there is a sense of urgency and desperation when Asuna’s memories are stolen away from her, driving up the personal stakes quite nicely. While not everyone might have had the best of experiences in SAO, Asuna was able to forge precious ones during her time there, one of them being a promise to go stargazing together with Kirito. Here, I would like to add that the plot did lend itself to some very genuine and tasteful emotional moments between Asuna and Kirito. In the end, the answer is to embrace the past, both the good and the bad, and to move on by focusing on the present and the future.
The movie ends on a perfect note, showing the passage from the SAO book that mentions Yuna in passing. While she is gone, she will live on in everyone’s memories because of her benevolent actions, showing that one’s actions are also important in determining and influencing how the self is constructed and remembered. This idea of agency is also brought to the forefront when we realize that Dr. Shigemura was selfishly trying to recreate Yuna against her wishes.
In terms of more general plot elements, I had absolutely zero issues with the pacing. Seriously, it was neither too fast nor too slow for me. The slower moments were inter-spaced between the adrenaline-pumping action scenes to allow for a breather and the action scenes recaptured my attention. I have to mention that many of the plot elements at the end were also set up right from the beginning (like the concert trap) and it added to the tightly-knit nature of the narrative. The solution to the problem did feel a little bit sudden, but it was explained and set up just enough for me to give it a free pass.
Moving on to fanservice, this was the part that impressed me the most. If you are an SAO fan (or at least have seen the first two seasons like I have), you will be floored by how many references they were able to seamlessly incorporate into the story while still making it feel completely natural. Here are some examples:
- Eiji was a previous Knights of the Blood guild member.
- As the AR headset required users to relive their traumas from their experiences in SAO in order for it to detect the appropriate memories to scan, they were made to fight familiar foes and monsters from SAO.
- The MMO Stream program interviewed numerous familiar players from ALO and GGO to get their opinions on the declining playership of VR games.
- The Medicuboid was used to scan Asuna’s brain for any damage, post-memory loss.
- In order to get a weapon powerful enough to defeat their foes, Kirito and the gang had to defeat the planned Floor 100 SAO boss (a treat to see in and of itself).
- To defeat the boss, we got to see all of them in their old outfits as they were restored along with their old levels and abilities (Sinon got her GGO outfit). Kirito’s Dual Wield? Yup. It’s in here.
- The players that we saw interviewed were summoned by Yui to help out in the final battle. Because we saw them at the beginning of the film, their presence was not jarring in the least.
- The BEST throwback, in my opinion, was Asuna using Yuuki’s Sword Skill in her SAO costume with Yuuki’s shadow appearing beside her. It was poignant and beautiful to see and it was used in the most perfect way – to show that Yuuki was there fighting alongside all of them during the big character reunion scene. I literally applauded right there and then.
This is how fanservice should be done. The fanservice was written for the story, not the other way around. Honestly, this movie felt like the culmination and progression of everything that came before it and I was flabbergasted by how cohesive everything was. Absolutely nothing went to waste.
Also, almost all of the characters were given their own time to shine on-screen in their new Ordinal Scale outfits with numerous, gorgeously animated action sequences… except for Suguha, bizarrely enough. She was away on a Kendo training camp or something, which was unfortunate. (Did we even see her Ordinal Scale outfit in the film?)
With regard to actual fanservice, there were two scenes of Kirito and Asuna kissing, two scenes of Kirito and Asuna on the bed (one of him pressing his face into her chest in a very non-sexual way) and one of Asuna bathing.
In conclusion, the movie was very clever in incorporating fanservice into the rather tight plot and nothing felt forced or contrived. Also, the themes were thought-provoking and pertinent, the emotions were genuine and the stakes were high. I also felt that the pacing was excellent, not too rushed and not too slow. In short, this movie was everything the Yu-Gi-Oh! Movie wasn’t. (Yes, I’m still bitter about that…) (>.<)
While this is a sequel movie, I think newcomers will be able to enjoy it due to how self-contained the story is, but I sincerely think that it’s best to have first watched the original two seasons to be able to fully appreciate the characters and get the full emotional weight of the references. Even if you aren’t a fan of the original (I know you probably aren’t), I highly recommend you give the movie a chance.",Positif
"(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)
As technology advances, so do the ways in which we consume its generated content.
Two of the more intriguing concepts warp our very perceptions: virtual reality (called VR) and augmented reality (called AR). VR puts us, the player, into a computerized world as if it were all we have ever known. AR keeps us in our understood space but instead adds those computerized elements as if they were a natural extension.
Both have their cool points and oddities, their benefits and detriments. In Sword Art Online Movie: Ordinal Scale, AR becomes the prominent vehicle, and its usage
leads down the next crazy path for this isekai-centric series.
STORY
Kirito, Asuna, and many others from the Aincrad incident have survived an unbelievable ordeal. The recent Gun Gale Online debacle raised further concerns, and the loss of a dear friend still stings. But life goes on. Their time within the death game they knew for so long is just about a faded memory, a forgotten nightmare at this point. Ordinal Scale, then, seeks to undo this trajectory.
Representing the first true film for the franchise, this next leg of the race has this divisive series moving away from VR for the moment as AR becomes all the rage. Using in-app utilities for health monitoring, keeping track of news. This powerful device of the future invites the populace with its technological wonders. And, of course, its video-game potential knows almost no bounds.
These two preceding paragraphs are important; they establish the major direction of the movie from the get-go. The plot considers their harrowing time within that old game, reflecting on if such a negative experience can be counted as worthwhile or if it should even be remembered in the first place. Such a theme bolsters strength in the narrative. As for AR, it affects the situation inherently, for it is tied to the realer setup. Not only in the cityscape setting but also in the content being an extension of their physical and mental worlds.
In the first half of the film, these worlds do a solid-enough job of forming the plot. It showcases Kirito and Asuna’s relationship and the promises they share, and it puts those cool fights front and center. Some slight comedic moments here, a few dastardly deeds there, and Yui tagging along all the while collectively craft for this anime a clear foundation.
Fans of the series will appreciate many of the different inclusions from previous installments. Visiting Kirito and Asuna’s personal lakeside cabin. Interacting with side characters from both previous seasons. Encountering familiar enemies from days of old. Ordinal Scale gives the audience some welcome callbacks that do not interfere with the plot but rather find a place naturally within its confines while also awarding the anime with some slick action sequences.
The second half more or less begins after Asuna suffers the same fate as some of her fellow Aincrad survivors. At this point, the narrative shifts gears as Kirito spearheads the charge of discovering the problems which surround them.
Arguably speaking, the last quarter or so of the film ramps up the pacing to a zany degree. True to form, Kirito slices and dices his way through the bosses and the rankings, pushing the film to its overall finale event without much care.
Furthermore, reading from a certain someone’s diary may be a bit too direct to get the message across, and the “doomsday clock” premise is a bit too obtuse. However, Ordinal Scale takes advantage of that earlier foundation, concluding these throughputs in satisfying fashion with romantic goodness and over-the-top brawling aplenty.
The film doesn’t achieve much else, though. While Kirito voices a few musings about AR, the concept and the comparisons with its VR counterpart rarely surface. Troubles with the underlying mystery and how it isn’t exactly the most enthralling subplot imaginable also pop up now and again.
Even so, Ordinal Scale delivers on what the Sword Art Online franchise has been built upon. Mixing the real world and the fantasy world. Neat battles. A mainstay couple at the helm. Sure, it is far from the most intriguing or the subtlest story around, but it at least provides a consistent, likable experience for the two hours-ish it demands.
ART & ANIMATION
Films tend to take on a higher caliber of visual splendor. Be it because of the smaller runtime affording better scheduling, the extra resources pooled into such ventures, or the theatrical venues in which they appear, reaching that “Wow!” factor becomes ever easier.
Ordinal Scale follows suit with impressive artistry, indeed. Standing out most within the movie are those all-important battles that Kirito, Asuna, and the others wage throughout the story. It spares no expense: colorful explosions, multiple camera angles, crazy abilities, huge scales, nicely choreographed moves. These awesome fight sequences highlight the film at its best, letting the audience absorb such animated treats with ease and expertise.
These fights commence in and around Kirito’s nearby city. Recalling the AR nature of the movie, the refined details for the buildings and the parks as well as the grounded view in general equate to a hefty amount of realism which sets the stage alight. Of course, Ordinal Scale incorporates the opposite end, morphing the playing fields into reimagined states of Aincrad’s various environments and even visiting it directly on at least one occasion.
The film also stays mostly within the nighttime hours for a gloomier atmosphere which mirrors the misfortune that permeates the air. As such, lighting and shadowing tend to be well-composed, too. And (perhaps expected) the character designs remain as crisp as always. Switching between casual clothes, their ALfheim Online looks, and their newer futuristic gear likewise increases the movie’s overall artistic clout.
Certain shots, such as a top-down first-person perspective of Asuna or an up-close frontal view of Suguha, can come off as feeling too on the nose in terms of capitalizing on apparent popularity. However, these scenes don’t outright ruin the movie, and they instead fall under that continued category of creating a fun experience for fans of this franchise.

It can be tough to develop people in a story who have gone through so much already, but Ordinal Scale does what it can to make it happen anyway.
At the minimum, the anime takes some extra time to explore Kirito and Asuna with increased focus on them and their connection. While the first season of Sword Art Online placed a sizable amount of attention on them (either together or in their feelings for one another) within the first season, the second season went in multiple different routes with other stories and newer characters. So, seeing a (in a way) return to form comes as a welcome surprise.
Granted, not that anything drastic or huge changes or grows between them. They are already a bona fide couple after all. But having the film return to their relationship in earnest showcases a deeper look into Asuna’s feelings and forms the major driving force behind Kirito’s actions throughout this new film. This look-see, at the very least, makes for a solid aspect within the film.
In fact, their bond hearkens back to the plot and the outcome of the tragic event they and so many others experienced. Whether those memories are best forgotten as painful or if those hardships matter because they define them for who they are now. Case in point, Kirito and Asuna have their fair share of troubling events, but they also shared many intimate moments they absolutely wish to hold dear forever.
Individually, Asuna faces her own trauma head on. Complications force themselves upon her, yet she displays stalwart conviction and mental fortitude as she either trusts Kirito or fights back against her demons all on her own.
Kirito’s arc fumbles a bit instead. He appears to have an interesting aside when the concepts of AR and VR differ in actual physical capabilities, putting him behind the others in his lax ways. That’s the extent of this line of thought, though, for he lives up to his storied self insofar as he catapults from almost useless to impossibly overpowered. Yes, Kirito (and indeed the series) just wouldn’t be himself if he weren’t wrecking the opposition, but it seems as if the film left this potential idea out of its scope.
Besides the main couple, Ordinal Scale also provides its handful of prominent side characters with limelight as well. Klein succumbs to the evils at work, and he questions his own memories in turn. Sinon supports Kirito to let him know that he doesn’t have to go at these problems alone. Silica worries with guilt over indirectly causing Asuna’s current predicament, a subplot which goes without a ton of momentum but adds a small extra layer to the writing. Even Agil gets in on the action. Not to the same extent or purpose as the others, but he can be found swinging his weapon around like the best of them.
Then the film falls apart again with its two newest characters: Eiji and Yuuna. While they take on a somewhat morally grey position in terms of defending the “other” side of the Aincrad incident, they don’t receive as much attention as possibly required. The audience gets the gist of who they are and their meager relationship together, but the mini-flashbacks and the sparse, infrequent scenes with them fail to reach any worthwhile developments or outcomes in either an individual or pairing sense. It turns these two not into an intriguing antagonist or a pitiable soul but rather a couple of (ironically) forgettable characters.
MUSIC & SOUND
Looking at the other half of the production values, the audio elements within Ordinal Scale spice up the film with their own flavors. For instance, the voice-acting performances remain at a veteran level for most of the characters across the board. Yoshitsugu Matsuoka in particular delivers on his signature role as he interacts calmly and yells with fervor.
The original soundtrack has many a foreboding tune and several intense pieces, improving the atmosphere and the power of its separate scenes. Yet it isn’t afraid to include some sentimental arrangements for those lighter or romantic moments. Not to mention the familiar tracks which ring in nostalgia as well, and the faux-insert songs from Yuuna that induce further intrigue.
And the breadth of sound-effects throughout the battles deserve some recognition, too. The clashing of weapons. Monstrous roars. Gunshots. Magical spells. Specialized move sets and attacks. While Ordinal Scale ensures that the visuals for these battles provide an eyeful, it also complements them with an aural edge that boosts their efficacy.
To play devil’s advocate, almost none of these elements leave a lasting impression or have an extensive finesse to them. Those VA performances don’t scream “incredible”; that OST hardly has any standout hits; these sound-effects may be expected or at least required given the subject and premise. Nonetheless, they contribute to the film’s overall success.
ENJOYMENT
Wanting to go into the third season of the franchise (which is currently airing as I type this out) without missing any of the major previous content, I took it upon myself to seek out this film before doing so. I don’t consider myself a mega-fan of this franchise, but I am not a hater either. I’m simply somewhere in-between. A person who likes it for what it is and finds its attempts at generating cool ideas around games and gaming worlds to be fun enough.
Luckily, the same thoughts carry over into this movie, for I liked what it presented per usual. As a dude big on romance, my heart was all aflutter as Kirito and Asuna bonded over their feelings for each other. Those fight segments were fun to watch, too, as they went about destroying the enemy creatures and then worked in unison with almost everyone else for larger spectacles.
Other parts had me interested as well. The comedy bits here and there, like when Asuna hurriedly backed away from Yuuna after winning again, had me chuckling. Yui’s enthusiasm in supporting her “parents” out whenever and however she could had me smiling wide. And, as always, Sinon was rad in her sniper-rifle ways, and Klein was a bro on and off the battlefield.
Truth be told, I didn’t much care for the new characters, but it was neat seeing their downfall or their kindness in the end. I also wasn’t exactly floored by the film in total, but I liked it more so than I believed I would once I finished watching it in its entirety. So, in my eyes, it proves that the series still has that entertainment factor going strong even after all these years.
Sword Art Online Movie: Ordinal Scale continues in its predecessors’ footsteps in a positive manner. A lot of cool action and a swell artistic vision allow this anime to move forward even if parts of the writing and the musical direction merely pass the execution mark. Thus, technology aside, the whole project advances another step.
SUMMARY
Story: Fine, this AR-centric tale neither has the smoothest pacing nor has too many meaningful moments, but the action-packed events, the sweet romance, the cool throwbacks, and the reflection on the past make the narrative at large a solid offering
Art & Animation: Great, awesome battle sequences, wonderful detail in the real-world setting, and crisp designs as always allow the visuals to grasp the audience’s gaze from start to finish
Characters: Fine, Kirito and Asuna’s relationship earn center stage once again, and the side characters join in as well, but Kirito himself lags behind with a non-nuanced arc, and newcomers Eiji and Yuuna fail to have much of a presence despite their importance
Music & Sound: Fine, nice VA performances, an intense OST, and a breadth of effects may not sparkle but still contribute with strength of their own
Enjoyment: Fine, another likable iteration for this popular series
Final Score: 6/10",Positif
"TL;DR: If you liked SAO, you'll probably like this too. And if you like Asuna x Kirito, you have to watch it.
__________________
Really nice movie and definitely a worthy sequel for SAO.
The story pretty much resembles the first two seasons, but I guess that's to be expected. There is some new technology (although this time it is AR instead of VR, giving it a nice change), some villain behind it and in the end, Kirito saves the day.
While watching the story unfold, you get to see more and more how it is actually tied to the events of SAO. Also, it gets pretty emotional in between.
As it is a movie, there is less time to spare than in a full season of a series, so their friends play not that big of a role apart from joining them in the fights. Instead, it mostly focuses on how Kirito and Asuna handle what happened to Asuna, and what Kirito tries in order to fix it.
Minor spoiler: Their relationship goes one step further as well.",Positif
"“Remember me? I was the one who would not abandon you. Even in death I was the one who would not leave you. Remember me?”
Are memories really that important?
Would you care if you lose them?
Would you, deliberately, cast them away?
SAO fans should know what to expect of this movie: the hype was sky-high, and Ordinal Scale met those lofty expectations, astonishingly!
After the Aincrad fateful events, Asuna and Kirito are back to the so called reality. The year 2026 elapses and, in it, a new crescent cosmogony; an inventive and conspicuous technology has emerged - Augma, an alternative system to the AmuSphere, where players can consciously
dive. More than a mere torsion of reality, Augma appears to be an extension of the tangible, transforming the seeing world before your very eyes. And, through this portal, amongst a myriad of other apps, Ordinal Scale exists, the most popular one, a RPG game. People use it every day, renouncing more and more the SAO world. Asuna, Lisbeth and Silica encourage Kirito to play, due to his reluctance, enticing him, since old foes from Aincrad have returned. Behind this wit, an eerie and occult mystery is growing, and the whispered word ""Switch"" will thicken that same subtlety.
A Sword Art Online survivor, a top ranking player, Eiji is his name, from the Knights of the Blood Oath, alongside a shady entity, is attempting an unprecedented and unreasonable milestone - bring back to life a girl named Yuna, who died in Aincrad. For that to befall the memories of SAO survivors are needed, in order to attain and restore every bit of information regarding Yuna's persona. (An alter ego serves as the iconic idol in the AR world of Ordinal Scale - a cute one.) A secret creeps and besieges around these three characters.
Into the nascent fantasy, you will encounter old bosses from SAO, in spectacular battles with fantastic, epic songs sung beautifully and composed fabulously - Kajiura Yuki in all her magnificent brilliance. ""delete"" by Yuna is breath-taking!
As the story proceeds, passing through an extremely suggestive bridge where Japan terminates and an admirable, transversal world begins, you will dive deeper into the development of the new characters, and the innermost evolution of Kirito and Asuna relationship, probably the most prominent couple in anime. Everyone else is here, too, from the original series and the second season, (Yui, Sinon, Leafa, Sakuya, etc.) and their interaction and importance is salient and strong, for we have learnt this from Kirito and his gamer solitude – friendship and fellowship are essential, making us do the impossible, a slow but progressive sedimentation, becoming unwavering, inexpugnable. For even in this, not so distant, near utopic future, the most primeval and prosaic sentiments are scrutinize and depicted, because, in the end, it is never just a story, or how you narrate it, but the emotion it can convey. Lastly, you will feel back in Swordland as you're in for a final surprise, a stupendous showdown of grandeur! Chilling and chanting.
On an unbiased basis, as an anime fan, i was completely absorbed by the might of this movie, all the artistry that floats and then flows through the screen, the animation, the music, script and seyuu talents, thrill and excitement.
Still, as a SAO enthusiast myself, i grandly loved this jewel. Adore!
So, what are you waiting for?

"For the most part, Sword Art Online has been a rather divisive series: you either like it a lot, or don't. Being one of the first few series that I have watched, the anime has a unique place in my heart, although I do have my fair share of criticism towards it too.
Now let's cut to the chase; in my opinion, despite its fundamental flaws due to the series as a whole, Ordinal Scale is nonetheless a good step forward from the anime. And without further ado, let's begin my first review!
Story: 6/10
Disclaimer: This part was written after having watched the whole anime series, so
newcomers' views may differ.
Ordinal Scale is set after the events of Mother's Rosario in SAO II and revolves around a new augmented-reality device, the ""Augma"", and the ARMMORPG ""Ordinal Scale"". However, things go awry and the well-being of its players becomes threatened, so our beloved protagonist, Kirito, has to step in.
Without spoiling the story, I'd like to say that the plot has improved from the anime series due to it dwelling less on poor, unnecessary character development and analysis and focusing more on action sequences, along with a comfortable pace that was easy to follow. However, the plot-armor/numerous plot-holes (which SAO, or more specifically, Kirito, is guilty of) as the movie approached the climax made it shy away from what could have been a very well executed masterpiece. The plot was also pretty predictable too, but arguably its simplicity could also be seen as one of its merits. Nonetheless, this is something you'll likely overlook if you're an avid fan of the series; in fact, arguably the plot seems to have been aiming to cater towards fans of the series in general, with lots of links to the first Arc (Aincrad) in particular. I feel that the less you dwell and nitpick on the logic of this movie, the better you'll enjoy and appreciate it.
Art: 7/10
Animation-wise, A-1 Pictures does a commendable job. Fight scenes were very fluid and the character designs were not vastly compromised despite having numerous scenes filled with many people in them. I particularly liked the designs of the two new characters in Ordinal Scale, namely, Yuna & Eiji. The enemies were also pretty menacing in appearance, and I totally understand the players' fear of having to face them up close. And in this one particularly emotional scene for the characters, the wavering in Kirito and Asuna's eyes was so well detailed, and it really brought out the gravity of the situation they were in.
I think A-1 Pictures maintained, if not improved, from the standards seen in the anime series, so kudos to them.
Sound: 9/10
The composer, Yuki Kajiura, does an excellent job yet again. The epic-vibes in the mostly orchestral music complemented the action sequences very well (and without spoiling anything, in fact contributed to the actual battles too). One of the Insert Songs in particular that played during the first boss fight (longing) sounded very similar to Fate/Zero's awesome OP 2 (a series Kajiura has worked on as well), and that is a great thing.
However! I'm not sure if this was just an issue in my cinema or where I was seated at, but the sound effects in the battles were noticeably loud and initially made my eardrums (and the rest of the audiences' too) ache a little. Do take note!
Character: 6-7/10
With regards to the new characters, they had lots of potential (Eiji in particular) but kind of fell short in the end.
Eiji, in particular, was a pretty decently written anti-Kirito (weaker in the virtual world but more powerful in augmented reality) who had a pretty simple yet understandable motive. I liked how he was rather straight-forward in terms of his character. Slight spoilers here, but I do wish they tied-up the loose ends in his story though, as he kind of just disappeared in the end, and perhaps a shot at redemption for him would have been very fitting. In general, I think Eiji deserved a lot more in the story, and I hope he does appear in future SAO media.
As for Yuna, thankfully she didn't end up as another harem addition. She's pretty key to the whole story, and I appreciate how her development wasn't lacking as much as I thought it would despite being a plot-device. I would say that she could have received much more development, but there's a particularly ""spoilery"" reason pertaining to the plot that explains why she is sort of constrained in this department. So I'm fine with her thus far.
Lastly, the new scientist dude... it's difficult to write about him without going through spoilers, but his role in the story was alright and I think he's someone the audience would understand well. But he is pretty simplistic of a character too, with not that much depth to him either.
Enjoyment: 7/10
As someone who likes SAO, I really appreciated the links to the previous works in the series, and I'm sure other avid fans would too. Apart from the aforementioned sound issues, the movie was very enjoyable. The presence of lots of fans during my screening and their candid reactions made the viewing more pleasurable too. Even if you come in with low expectations (likely due to the anime series or poor word-of-mouth) or not knowing the series at all, Ordinal Scale is a movie that would be pretty difficult to dislike unless you are the movie-goer who often nitpicks on things.
VERDICT:
All in all, Ordinal Scale could be said to be a shining addition in the otherwise slightly-mediocre Sword Art Online anime series. Reki Kawahara's improvements in writing (as seen in Progressive in Alicization) manifest especially well here. This movie is not a must-watch, but you wouldn't regret watching it either. 7/10 for me!",Positif
"SAO comes from Overrated Anime to over-hate Anime. I am not hating this anime, but I am not very like this too. To be honest, this anime has great story concept but very bad execution. But the movie is different..
The movie is not a best movie, but it is far better than the anime series its self.
The story is more focused to Action and still very enjoyable. There is still has kirito-asuna romance story. This movie is very similar enjoyable to marvel movie, in my opinion.
I don't have any doubt about Art, Visual, Animation, and Music. Very very good..
If you like an action
anime and light plot story  or you search a movie to enterain yourself, this Anime movie is very recommended for you..",Positif
"This review contains spoilers for both the film itself and season 1 of SAO.
A Sword Art Online movie was a good proposition. The one area of near-universal praise that the franchise has attracted is for its visuals. Animated movies have higher and more focused budgets than TV serials, which means prettier graphics and more fluid animation. The reduced overall running time makes it harder to find space for a large ensemble cast or a complex narrative - things SAO has spectacularly failed to implement in the past. A movie, then, sounds like a good chance for it to focus on its strengths and minimize its
faults.
It's too bad that they chose an AR-based story to adapt into the movie. The first season of SAO was at its best when it depicted the sense of wonder that arose from exploring its fantastical online worlds. The streets of modern Japan, at least for me, can't measure up to that feeling, even when enhanced with holograms of magic and monsters.
If we are to evaluate an anime on its own terms, we can't waste much time complaining that some of the fight-scenes in this don't add much to the story or progression. Nor indeed should we criticize the scene where Asuna takes a bath and the camera makes a point of treating us to a generous view of her bum. SAO is a dumb franchise whose only real purpose is to give us the visceral appeal of looking at things we find pretty. On that note, and for his part, Kazuto doesn't get a bath scene but looks great in his Ordinal Scale uniform.
This movie starts off with a lot of promise. It doesn't waste too much time getting to its well-animated fight scenes (the first one is about 15 minutes in, but that's responsible pacing.) What I particularly like is that Kazuto is struggling in AR games and sits around feeling left out while everyone else has fun with them. He's out of shape and physically weak, and these flaws are finally hindering him now that AR is such a fad. Seeing him alone and morose, and knowing it's because of his own faults, makes him more sympathetic than usual. There's even a rather amusing scene where he trips over a curb in the middle of a fight.
The film's antagonist, Eiji outclasses him completely when he arrives. This is a first for the series. He injures Asuna while Kazuto is nearby but helpless to prevent it, and then he effortlessly beats down Kazuto himself. That leaves our hero on his own to get to grips with his wimpy real-life body and his skills in the new game.
Unfortunately that character growth is rushed. Kazuto struggles a little in one AR battle and then the movie skips forward to the point where he's one of the great players, practically defeating major boss encounters on his own.
Two hours is an above average length for a film, and can be especially costly for an animated project. It is possible to make an anime film that long that feels like it uses all its time purposefully and packs a lot of meaning and development into its run-time. Just look at Akira for a great example of that. Ordinal Scale is not that kind of movie. It's loaded with slow-paced dialog, dull internal monologues, and flashbacks, even re-using animation from previous seasons of the T.V. show. It feels like 60-90 minutes worth of content that was watered down and stretched out to fill 120.
I felt that the climactic battles were a particularly big let-down. When Kazuto finally faces Eiji again, the film cuts to an idol's musical performance and a large portion of the fight takes place off-screen. Perhaps to Japanese viewers the idol performance, which had also seen significant build-up throughout the film, would be exciting enough to justify this, but to me it was incredibly frustrating. Kazuto rips off an artificial enhancer that apparently explains all of Eiji's strength and then immediately dispatches his now-helpless opponent, which is a deeply underwhelming resolution. It would feel more like the hero had overcome a great obstacle if his enemy were truly strong rather than a cheater. I feel like there has never been a really satisfying moment of high-energy uninterrupted sword-fighting in this entire goddam anime. Like Kazuto early in this film, it's always tripping over itself with exposition or strange digressions.
The film's final battle, against the 100th floor boss monster from SAO, takes place in VR. We'll leave aside the fact that SAO's creator previously stated that he himself was intended to be the 100th floor boss and that therefore there should not have been some other entity coded into that place. What the switch to VR for the big climax signals is the pointlessness of the entire film. All of the skills Kazuto has learned and the weaknesses he's overcome throughout the movie are rendered irrelevant in its big final battle. The changes it makes to the characters are all reversed by the end and the AR technology will never come back to the spotlight. This Ordinal Scale story has zero significance to the story of Kazuto himself. It is not art, and makes no pretense of being art. It's a silly fan-service heavy distraction that will keep you occupied for two hours but that ultimately contains no substance.",Positif
"Every other review has most of the reasons as to why this anime is decent & flawed. But for postivive reviews, there are always negative ones to balance them out. I gave it a rating of 8 because it left an impression on me. However, I feel as though some of the reviews which are negative by nature are biased. They only state how terrible the anime is without listing out pros and cons, they only list out the cons that trigger them. I find it pretty idiotic to lash out at an anime for being bad just because you hate the original series, you
overlook all the pros just to state the cons, pretty childish. It’s quite obvious that a review is biased when you state how something shouldn’t be possible scientifically, and when that something exists within an - “anime” its apparently so mindblowing that you’d use it as a base for a flaw. Sure, its a sci-fi kind of anime where their reality is somewhat similar to ours, however people don’t hate on Steins Gate just because their method of time travel is absurd. Well, tldr, watch this movie if you like the main series & don’t read the biased reviews.",Positif
"To the review! (Keep in mind my second review ever! And I am Finnish so not the most perfect english if mistakes are present)
Quickly to say I loved the movie. As I have always loved SAO. A thing many people would disagree with, but what can I say I also like ""the Prequel Trilogy"".
And I would recommend but ONLY if you have seen the previous installments of Sword Art Online.
Story:
Story in this was interesting. I would say it was the most interesting story out of all of the SAO stories. But it does require that you have seen the previous shows. I would rate it
10/10..
Art:
I am not good with this. I am not a critic and definetly not an art critic. In my humble opinion its one of the best animation I have seen in an anime. Better than any of the other SAO but it is an movie so. So yes 10/10 one of the best if not the best animation I've seen in anime.
Sound:
Music like in all SAO is incredible, this is not the best SAO ost but it is still top quality from what I have seen.
Character:
I have actually always liked all the SAO characters. Which of the best one is Asuna. And I am glad that Asuna was in this a lot. Kirito which of I see is usually not liked amongst people of what I have seen but I never had seen him as a bad character.
Only problem with characters is that characters like Lisbeth, Silica, Agil? and Klein are so minor small characters that they just are there. It feels like they are yelling Can you remember me from the previous shows? They have always been kinda lacking to me, Characters outside Kirito, Asuna, Sinon and Suguha. The villains and Yuuna where actually not too bad, They were interesting.
So 7/10 because one of them is a waifu so bias is true. And of course lacking side characters
Enjoyment:
Not really sure what this is supposed to mean as I kinda count it in the overall thing but I enjoyed it a lot. And I bet if you liked the SAOs before you will too. But if you have not seen the previous shows or disliked them yeah don't watch it if you have doubts. It is quite long 2 hours. But because I like SAO lengths doesn't matter. it could have been longer sure! Build Agil? and Klein and the rest more! (10/10)
Overall:
Umm. Well 10/10.... Watch it!",Positif
"SAO is a series you either love or hate, and remains one of the more divisive anime out there. I personally love it - while recognizing the reasons why others do not. That being said, even those critical of SAO will want to give Ordinal Scale a watch. It's a breath of fresh air to SAO, with greatly improved action content and development/screentime more evenly distributed among the series' characters.
Story: 7/10
The switch from VR to AR is interesting, especially since we get to see the characters struggle to adapt to ""real life"" combat and the blending of the virtual and real worlds. The plot is
also full of throwbacks and added lore to the Aincrad arc, something that most fans will agree is welcome. I will stop short of calling it great however, as the movie does have some hokey moments that require a little suspension of disbelief to enjoy, and there was a greater focus on action scenes over plot than there'd been in the original series.
Art: 8/10
The art, while phenomenal, felt quite a bit different than the original - not that surprising since it's now 5 years old. None the less it was really well done, especially the fight scenes which felt much more dynamic than those in the original series did.
Sound: 9/10
I was really excited to see LiSA (who gave us both OP1 ""Crossing Field"" from the first arc and ED3 ""Shirushi"" from SAO II) returning to the series, and she didn't disappoint. Her OP/ED ""Catch the Moment"" was fantastic, as were the rest of Yuna's songs by various artists. Heck, we even get a song from Silica in what is undoubtedly her cutest moment in the series so far. Some of the best BG music from the original series is re-used, especially whenever Aincrad lore is invoked, and it's great.
Character: 9/10
SAO is primarily a character-driven series, and Ordinal Scale does not disappoint here. A significant amount of screentime and development is given to Kirito and Asuna's relationship, but also to the original cast who many feel were unfairly sidelined after the first arc. Klein, Egil, Liz and Silica all get their moment in the spotlight, and minor characters from every arc are brought back for brief roles throughout the movie. The OCs of the movie, Eiji and Luna, are really well done and give us a whole new insight into the tragedy behind the frontlines of SAO.
Sinon also gets some screentime with Kirito, something those who prefer that fanpairing will be happy to see. Leafa is mostly written out of the story, which is the only thing that keeps this from being a 10/10 in my opinion. However the writers have a good justification: with OS being an AR game based on real life sword skill, kendo champ Suguha would've stolen the show!
Enjoyment and Overall Rating: 8/10
The short of it is: if you loved SAO, or at the very least loved the Aincrad arc of SAO, you will love Ordinal Scale. Even critics of the series will enjoy the action scenes of the movie compared to the original and the fact that the movie is not purely focused on Kirito. It's got the perfect balance of action, tragedy and romance that made the original SAO such a hit, and is visually and musically stunning. I definitely recommend it, but for those who absolutely cannot get over the cornier parts of the plot of the series, you may enjoy it less than I did.",Positif
"First time writing a review on this site so here it goes! Overall I enjoyed this movie a lot.  The story was well thought and made sense.  The art was really good.  I feel like one of the reasons why Sword art online is such a popular series is cause of its artwork and the movie has the best artwork of the series so far with some awesome fight scenes. Sound was good, nothing that stood out or disappointed. The characters were awesome, they never fail to disappoint.  We saw some new characters and some old ones that I forgot about
that I was glad to see again.  We have some nice romantic scenes between Kirito and Asuna which I really wanted cause there seemed to be a lack of those moments in Sword Art Online 2.  Overall, its a good movie for sword art online fans:)",Positif
"I was initially not planning to do this review, but since I saw many other reviews with bad reasons to give it a low score i am doing this.
First of all I want to take a moment to talk about the characters and how many emotions you feel with them. This movie has kirito and Asuna as protagonists. Almost always you are feeling what they feel. This helps you to really care about them.
The villain was REALLY good. His purporses are really believable and some people may understand him and even feel empathy for him. The villain is so well done that you will not
recognize what he really wants until he has almost done it. I would give it a 9.7
Other thing I want to point out is that I loved the AR thing. I could really more less understand the situation that they are in because in real life (when it was a trend) A lot of people played pokemon go and they would do anything to catch those pokemons. Something similar happens here.
Something I have to mention is the NOSTALGIA I felt while watching this. There are mentions and flashbacks to SAO series and it makes you really remember those moments. Only people who liked the series or light novels will understand how good those moments were, this is why I can not blame anyone for not liking the movie and not understanding how important those moments were.
The general plot was like the anime. A game that starts becoming more and more serious. The hidden meaning of this movie is represented as a question; How far would you go for the ones you love?.
The kirito and Asuna moments are great making you fall in love with those characters.",Positif
"I have kind of stopped writing reviews as of late for a few reasons, but I went to see this film last night and it really made me want to say a few words about it.
The art was just spectacular and it was nothing less from the mega franchise of SAO. The way that the world would transform around them and become the fantasy-esq world is one of the coolest ways that they could make the real world exciting and enjoyable to look at. I would actually enjoy watching the different areas change into something dark and evil that was once just a normal
office building. It gave depth to the style of art by allowing it to have a seamless transform right before your eyes. The colors and the costumes were also a nice change of pace from the anime TV series, but the fan-service near the end was a much appreciated nod to those who fell in love with the anime from the start.
The music direction was pretty important I would say throughout the whole film. With music being the primary goal of Yuna and all of that going for her, they actually had great in-movie songs as well as a fantastic soundtrack. I loved hearing those piano melodies behind an emotional scene (and there were a lot of them) but there was also a lot of room for growth and a lot of impact music. it made each scene feel alive and real rather than just a screen, it was able to fully immerse me in the film.
The story was pretty good i would say, kind of falling short at some points, and the main antagonists motives were not readily clear (which could be a good thing but to me it was just annoying). The use of Augmented reality video games is not a super new concept, especially with Pokemon GO breaking out on the scene last summer, but the way they used it in this sense makes me long for it in real life. Don't get me wrong i wish i could still go Full Dive but if AR is the best i can get? SIGN ME UP. either way the AR game starts to seemingly affect people in strange ways and when Asuna and others are in danger, Kirito has to step up and do his best to save them. Pretty standard SAO plot structure I'd say.
My personal enjoyment was through the roof. I loved this film and it made me so happy to actually go see it in the theater. I througholy enjoyed every bit of the emotional story that focused on Kirito and Asuna's relationship and by the end i was tearing up just because of how happy I was. There was a lot of fan-service (as in they gave the fans what they wanted, not just ecchi type stuff) and to be honest it fit really well. I enjoyed seeing the characters in certain environments and the final battle was really something that i think a lot of fans were hoping for. This film is a great film to watch if you've never seen SAO, but you will appreciate it so much more if you have.
Overall Rating - 9.5/10",Positif
"This review contains opinion based thoughts and spoilers.
Compared to anime shows that had a move adaption, Sword Art Online Ordinal Scale does this extraordinary well. Much on par with Stein's Gate Deja Vu, Ordinal Scale acted as a sequel to its show and performed movie entertainment. However there is minor flaws to this film that I will explain later on
Story 7.5/10
Ordinal's scale's story has shown well developed progression throughout the series of Sword Art Online. With the well known theme ""gaming anime"" in the anime world, this film has done its best to be unique and continues on after the series. Most anime adapted
movies acts as non-canon or is a summary to the show itself, loses its potential to reach that Band 6. However, the story has too much complexity without no explanation, especially at the end of the film. This tend be covered by ""plot armor"" or ""because its anime"", but I can't really let it slide.
Animation 10/10
Lets be honest, animation was on point. The fighting scenes has impressed me with movie quality movement and produced an atmosphere of adrenaline. The sound effect and the fast pace moving movement from the characters, gave me shivers across my spine. The design on the characters and the landscape are gorgeous and the swords clashing, just reminds me of Fate Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works 2014.
Character 7/10
Ordinal Scale indicates parts that went wrong in the show and fully correct in the movie. As the series was based on Kirito himself, this movie has done well to involve everyone instead of just Kirito. This was largely profound through Asuna and Klein. The involvement of other characters were great and all, but the new and antagonist of the film disappointed me. The antagonist may had a strong determination, but portraying that determination was too quick and plain. The term ""looking at both sides"" had very low focus on the antagonist whilst it was focusing the antagonist's power.
Music 8.5/10
The soundtrack of this film continuously impressed me. The vocalist OST sang by Lisa makes the battle's atmosphere more adrenaline and the Main theme (movie version) acts as an indication of an amazing experience. I would give it a 9, but portraying as a musical concert throughout the film made me...uncomfortable (really based opinion alert). Musical concert in anime does not really peak my interest so I'm giving it a 8.5
Overall: 8.3/10
Overall, I would say it was one of the best anime series adaption movies but not on par with anime movies like ""your name"" and Studio Ghibli films. It has definitely made me watch the movie without stopping and it creation on its atmosphere, gives pins and needles. If you are a SAO hater or disliked the series, I do recommend watching this film as it acts as a public opinion development",Positif
"There was a certain girl, who had come home from a certain movie theater, after watching a certain 4k movie. She lay there on her bed, and thought to herself while sipping hot sauce, because her dad was too cheap to buy juice that day,
""You think they would have learned by now? That EVERY NEW VR GAME HAS A CATCH TO IT!?""
But no. They Didn't learn.
SAO Ordinal Scale is not what I expected, but I surprisingly enjoyed it. I personally don't hate SAO, I just don't like Kirito that's all.
So anyway, I will tell you from my perspective on SAO: Ordinal Scale.
I watched it
in a movie theater, I don't know if it was because it was on a Thursday, but there was literally no one there when I watched, kinda said how in my area (Chicago!) even mainstream is not mainstream, so there were only me, my brother, and my dad, and two other guys, that's it, how sad.
The people said it was dubbed, but when we were there it was actually subbed, which for me was a pleasant surprise, but my brother was a little miffed cause he likes dub.
Let me just get straight to it, visuals, voice acting and sound, AMAZING it really blew my mind, the action was amazing too. Don't expect the same experience, because you might not watch this movie in a theater in 4k, but this was actually my first anime movie in a theater before, so I was really excited.
The movie is around two hours long, so we were there for a bit. One problem I have with the action is that it starts off really well, but then the fights gradually get shorter and shorter, until literally one slash and 20 bosses are defeated. Another thing I didn't like was the various plot holes unexplained.
This isn't really a spoiler, it's just there was one part where Yui ""loaded"" the characters save files from SAO when they were fighting a boss, and they immediately became like 1 million times stronger which.........what?
But anyway if you pay attention you will see the myriad of unexplained plot holes at the end.
There was even information that the movie got wrong. Trying to save 10,000 original SAO players....when approximately 4000 died....and that left only 6000 survivors, but hey whatever, I'm just being critical. I enjoyed the movie, my dad didn't he doesn't care for anime at all. If you like SAO watch it, if not.....you can still watch it so you can hate on it, I really don't care. I just hope you enjoyed my review! Thank you!",Positif
"This is my first review, I am a huge fan of SAO. Me - not that person to write or talk much, but I'll say that I loved the movie, tho, the regular episodes probably more to my liking because theres more time to spend on them and get into it.
Kirito is being just a badass as always, still has a part of Beater inside of him, while Asuna tries to keep strong and not prepares to give it away. Other than that, I was like 25% sure what would happen to the 2nd place guy. And the rest characters did not really get
into my eye.
But the biggest thing that almost made me cry from happiness, was when at the end, I saw the text... The last words on screen...
P.S. Watched in KissAnime",Positif
"Hello, everyone. KnownAsVirtual here. I have a twitter by the same name. This is will be my 2nd review. I'm very mediocre with grammar so bare with me each time you see me make a review/case.
To start with: Wow the wait for this movie was worth it. I initially turned down the opportunity to see it here in the states in theaters back in March. Probably a bad idea, maybe. But not one with patience. December 19th Ordinal Scale will be on Blu-Ray.
Story: Okay, The story for SAO I gave a 9/10. Why? Technology butterflies never waiver and Augmented Reality System is brought into
play in the year 2026. It seems Kirito and the gang can't escape from how reality faces them. While Asuna and the others are really getting the hang of the Augmented/Ordinal Scale system. Kirito in the beginning of the movie is real hesitant which I noticed big time. I mean, who can blame him. SAO, the game of murderous intent and bad memories. Not a thing you can hope to forget about and have a new AR tech bring forth gaming reality into the real world. Talk about insane. Anyway, 2 hour films always excite me. They show promise. A lot can be done with them. Ordinal Scale played it perfectly.
Art: I tweeted this on twitter. I believe this to be one of A-1's best animated creations of their history. You may not agree with me, that's okay. But, I had to express myself with this. It captivated me with it's motion too when the Kirito and Asuna fought a former SAO boss brought into reality. I thought it was smooth. Explosions, skills, everything. I was impressed.
Sound: Also a 9, as I stated in the art the motion was splendid so when I saw an explosion go, BOOOM. I was left feeling awed. My headphones are Bose. But even so I heard the crisp of the fighting, the breathing, the talking, everything.
Character: To me this section falls on characters.
Asuna: Wow, for once fans who love her like myself are given pretty clear view of who she really is and her relationship towards Kirito. Not to mention she'll go to the ends of the earth for him. Risk it all. I felt she stayed strong in this movie despite the story plot that would once again drive her into despair.
Yuuna: I feel she deserves some love. The story plot for Ordinal Scale and not to mention SAO itself has without doubt been cruel to her. I think she's lucky to have a father who thinks of her too. If you watch though, it's shaky business. Her spirit though is kind and I can see why she's adored.
Eiji: I can not blame him for what he did in this movie. He was in love/but also in wreck.
Enjoyment: It's in my belief to never give an anime a 10. But that for overall score. This is different. I seriously enjoyed this movie more than the S1 and S2 combined. I was in awe for most of it. I really am speechless. As an SAO fan, I hope A-1 gives us fans a S3. I hope there's also closure to this series one day. But for now. The legendary Black Swordsman will live on.
Overall: 9/10. No complaints from me. A worthy 2 hours of my time.",Positif
"Same conflict as SAO S1 condensed into a different setting, however this time our hero starts off rock bottom before rising.
The Black Swordsman Rises.
Now for the villain.
The villain's motivation are flawed in the sense that their very actions are insanely contracting.
Claims to be at fault, claims to be willing to do anything to fulfill their objective.
Committing the same misdeeds as a previous villain, the same villain that has backed SAO:OS's villain into a corner.
With the given technological setting, the only choice for the villain is to sacrifice himself for his own objective. After all they were willing to do anything, and he is the
most genuine source of ""data"" for his motive. No, he needs to commit himself to inhumane and illegal acts that will ruin any chance for him to reach his goal. When he can go into a dark corner and sacrifice his own ""data"" and have an accomplice see to it his intentions are carried out at the cost of  only 1 potential casualty if it can even be called that.
Far too many holes where the Villain's flawed script ruins the story. Sometimes a silent villain makes the best villain while having environmental and interactions between the main chars and victims do all the exposition. Which is certainly ascertainable for the astute viewer.
Spoiler Warning:
Can scan, extract and return ""memories,"" but can't make copies (or record either, or there would be a record of the main victim's memories stored somewhere after the SAO incident).",Positif
"I've watched the SAO series back when I had only just begun watching anime. Since then, my taste in anime has matured a lot. For that reason I cannot compare my enjoyment from back then and the one I got from watching this movie. I can't compare the plot or characters, as the eyes that once saw Sword Art Online are now long gone. I loved it back then, and watching this movie makes me feel like I was right to enjoy it. Makes me doubt all the hate it was given. However, now I see that the plot is pretty bad. It feels like
an excuse for the action to happen. If you think too hard about it, much won't make sense, but that's fine. It entertains. It doesn't waste much time either. The focus is clear: Action. Maybe for that reason that it doesn't fall apart.
Strangely enough, watching this movie wasn't nostalgic at all. It felt new. Perhaps, as it was mentioned by others, I felt that way because they really did something different. And I believe that thing is focusing on the action.
The character drama is still there, but it doesn't feel forced, just out of place. Like it was borrowed from another story. It is not necessarily bad, it just doesn't evoke any strong emotions.
What matters the most is done right. The visuals are beautiful and the action scenes are stunning. I saw a little bit of the Fate series in it, but hey, the producers are the same, and it works, right? So it's all good.
For those that liked the rare development in the romance area that the original series presented us, rejoice! It is here to bless us with its grace. I love it when the characters actually get into a relationship before the series end! We get to enjoy that beautiful feeling with them. I hope it will catch on, because I get real frustrated of all these romance-bait-harem anime.
The idol girl (Yuna), with her songs in the battles was pretty dope and well placed. A good excuse for a good fighting soundtrack.
All in all, it is SAO. It isn't a masterpiece, but you'd be dreaming to hope for one. It's fun and entertaining. It has some AMV worthy battles and cute little moments between Asuna and Kirito.
It's pretty good.",Positif
"Today was the second I've seen Ordinal Scale, after seeing it in a cinema the first time. Ordinal Scale is one of the BEST movies I've seen so far, despite it being SAO.
I don't know what they did but SAO improved greatly after Season 2. (I haven't seen the GGO Anime)
It's also one of the best looking movies, not as good as Heaven's Feel though. So after all, I'd actually give it a 10. I liked the music, the characters (especially the relationship between Kazuto and Asuna) and I loved the way the movie looks like.
I would recommend the movie to everyone, even if
you didn't like Season 1 and 2.",Positif
"Let's Start by Saying that I Review things from a film perspective, not a personal perspective.
If i do have something personal to say it would be (written inside brackets like this)
Alright Let's get this over with!
[Story] 4/10 - To Avoid spoilers I wont say anything about it. Though I will say that the story is followable, it makes sense and is fairly decent. The newer concepts in this film make it much better than it's counterparts ie SAO series. It is rushed, which makes it a lot worse. If the pacing was slower this would definitely be ranked higher.
[Art] 9/10 - Throughout the series and
into this film, SAO has yet to have horrible art. It still makes it's mark by having amazing graphical scenes and images. I would like to go deeper into the Art Section as usual so im splitting in into categories.
[Animation] 8/10 - The battle scenes in the series and in the film are still wonderfully animated. Though some of the animations in the more story related scenes could be better, it's still not very distracting.
[Design Choices] 9/10 - I have never faulted SAO for having horrible design choices. It's characters and strange monsters/beings have yet to be horribly designed. This would be a 10 if some of the monsters were so simple.
[Sound/Music] 9/10 - This is amazing! The choice of music and sound is perfect in this film. The best and most notable feat of sound is during the more serious/somber scenes. Sometimes no music at all during scenes makes it hit harder and this does it perfectly. I was never taken out of scene due to its music choice. Oh yeah the songs are pretty good too. None of them are weak, they all make sense and fit with the film
[Character] 7/10 - SAO's initial problem was character development and it still is their weakest and most noticeable problem. There are around 8 main characters throughout the whole series. And developing 8 characters can be really hard. I would have loved to see more into certain characters, which is why I absolutely loved the GGO arc of season 2. Where they flesh out a character over multiple episodes. Since this is a film however, you have to develop characters within a certain time frame. Smaller scenes where the characters are just talking to each other would be nice. More one on one situations would have been nice. But this film shows just enough for it be good. It's definitely better that most of the series, but this still is a lacking department in the series. (I really hope the creators improve character development in the future)
[Enjoyment] 8/10 - I had some time to spare so I decided to sit down and watch this by myself. It was rarely boring, I had a few laughs (though they were mostly laughing at how bad some scenes were) It was a roller coaster of emotions. I spent time to admire the art, admire the music and re-watched some battle scenes. It had my attention for a long time, though during around the 40-ish minute mark I started to get a bit distracted. This is a personal section of the review as I cannot look at enjoyment from a critical point of view. But I can say this. If you love action, This is the movie for you. If you love some touching scenes, This is the movie for you. IF you are a fan of the series, then definitely watch this movie!
[Overall Score] 7/10 - It was really hard to go into depth of the movie, especially since I cannot spoil it. So i wasn't able to point out most of the bad parts of the film. This film accels in it's art/design and sound/music. In fact it's one of the best i've seen in that department. But this film lacks in the story/plot and the character development department. There is alot that's great about this film and a lot that's bad about this film overall leading it to being a devently good movie, it's still balanced around a 6/10 to a 7/10 for me. Really depending on if I wanted to get all nit picky with the film. But I will say this. It's a good movie, probably a good one if you want to watch it with friends. You guys will most likely have a great time watching it. Do i recommend this film? Yeah... While i may not recommend the series in itself, I do say that this movie really is worth it. I'm glad that it wasn't rushed and they took time making this. If you are in a good mood and want to watch a good movie, put this on.
Thank you for reading my Review! Have a nice rest of your day!",Positif
"When I heard this movie was focusing on augmented reality as opposed to virtual reality (like every other SAO story so far), I thought it was going to be a step down, but it ended up bringing a breath of fresh air to the franchise that I didn't think was possible. The plot was very interesting, but the execution was merely average. They could have done a lot more to bring more meaning to the emotions they were trying to make the audience feel.
I feel like its greatest strength is also its biggest weakness; it caters specifically to fans of the show. I say it's
a strength because if you like the show, you'll definitely enjoy this. It's a spectacle of clanging swords, and brightly coloured, loud, and epic fights bigger than anything in the show. It's got all those endearing character dynamics and clichés, too. However, if you haven't consumed any of the preceding media, a lot of the backstory elements (and even present story elements) will be lost on them.
Best parts:
- The enhanced animation looks amazing
- THE SOUND. MY GOODNESS, THE SOUND DURING THE BATTLES IS JAW-DROPPING
- The fanservice scene that is essentially hentai",Positif
"This movie was a time well spent for me. Perhaps one of my now favourite anime-movies?!
Overall I give it a 9 - to me it was great.
I watched it with some ""lag"" but I think that the enjoyment of this movie was 10/10. I never got annoyed or bored or frustrated. It was just 100% enjoyment through the entire film and that was a relief!
The art & sound was both excellent, loved it. I give a 9 to both due to the fact that it always can improve.
The characters is an 8, they were very good but I feel that personally, there are a
few things I would have wanted to be a little different in order to enjoy the characters more. I.e. Asunas behaviour, but only slightly in a different direction. Not much at all.
Story is also an 8, it might be so that it deserves a 9 but it felt a little rushed at some points and despite that the movie always kept a good flow.",Positif
"This movie is pretty much exactly what I wanted from an SAO movie. In terms of plot line, the focus on the film is on Kirito and Asuna's relationship, as well as how it is linked to their time in Aincrad. It does a pretty good job with this, and though it doesn't have a lot of depth to it, it feels consistent with the characters and does hit some good emotional beats, especially with the ending. The rest of the previous cast is also present, and almost everyone gets a bit of time to shine, but largely aren't that important. What is more important
is the new characters introduced Eiji and Yuna, who aren't that memorable, but who are competent at being the other driving force behind the plot opposite to Kirito and Asuna. This plot is relatively simple and resolved adequately in a reasonably satisfying manner over the course of the movie. Hence, while it did get a bit slow at points, overall I'd have to say the plot did a pretty good job at driving the film forward at a good pace.
Now that's all well and good, but rather than plot, I would have to say what actually makes the film amazing is that it seems to focus on aspects other than the plot. In terms of action, the film is fantastic, having incredibly well animated fight scenes. The action combat is so simple that it doesn't even really warrant any explanation into it's mechanics, but it's still ends up being really cool. Part of this is that it flips the script completely on Kirito from the switch from VR to AR, and hence gives him a major hurdle to overcome, that he still manages to pull it off. The highlight of the movie is the final major battle. It's well animated and the action is great, but  beyond that, regarding how it plays out, its just really amazing. Looking back, it seems that they had to force it to make it happen, but it was worth it because it hits a very large number of notes, arguably every single one, in regards to appealing to SAO fans. It's just a steady steam of awesome things happening in quick succession that legitimately made me smile.
The art was really good along side the animation. Yuna's design was good, though the designs for most everyone else felt somewhat weak but I suppose that was for the sake of being consistent with the atmosphere of the real world and set up the change at the end. The soundtrack was great, with Yuna's tracks fitting very well, and with the LiSA ending closing things off perfectly.
tl;dr: A movie that excels in the areas SAO does well, and does a good job in the areas that it doesn't, in part by focusing less on them.",Positif
"*Note: This will end up being my first review for the site, so please bare with me as I'm starting to write these publicly.*
Ah, Sword Art Online, one of the most polarizing anime series ever made. You either love it or hate it with a burning passion. It's become a running joke among the anime community for many years now, and I myself have had a love/hate relationship for it during my time being an otaku. However, it holds a special place in my heart because of the time that I watched it, and how it promoted me to find many other animes to watch,
some of which I love to this very day, It has a lot of problems and inconsistencies in terms of the story, however, which I think holds it back from being truly great. Nonetheless, it's a series that I enjoy watching a lot from time to time, and, considering that Season 3 is finally upon us, my lazy butt finally got around to watching Sword Art Online's first motion picture, Ordinal Scale. Wait, did I not mention Extra Edition? Well, it wasn't really a film as it was pure recap, but we won't go there.
Story: The story of this film is anime original, taking place after the first two seasons of the series. I'd recommend you to start the series that way, just because there are very minor spoilers contained in the film about the series. The story is very basic and simplistic, and the best way that I can put it is that it's typical SAO fare. I did like the story, but there were many inconsistencies in it that did bother me. I won't go into it in case of spoilers, but this is no surprise considering the original series had this same problem. Thankfully, however, the film does avoid a decent chunk of the issues that held the series so far back in the past. It was far from a masterpiece, but I enjoyed what I watched for the most part. I wouldn't suggest going into this film for the story, though.
Characters: The characters in the film are the same characters that have been in the franchise since the beginning, so there's nothing new in terms of this category. Kirito is still the ""Black Swordsman"" or ""Jesus-kun"" of the series (unfortunately), Silica and Lizbeth are kinda useless still, and Klein's kinda there to be the punching bag (despite how much I kinda resonate with him, he's a pretty chill character in my opinion). Sinon (aka best girl) is also there, which is nice, although she doesn't do a helluva lot throughout the film, but I do like how much screen time and attention Asuna was given. After seeing her take the wheel in the Mother's Rosario arc of Season 2, I've grown to really appreciate her character that much more, and that trend still continues here. The antagonists of the film weren't necessarily compelling by any means, but the backstories of both Eiji and the head of the Toto Corporation were tragic, and I could kinda resonate with their emotional struggles. I do wish that we got more screen time for their development, but what I still got from them was satisfactory enough to give it a mention.
Art/Sound: The animation of the film, much like the series, is great. The fight sequences are very well animated and action-packed, and that I believe is one of the films biggest strengths. Some of the CGI look a little tacky, in my opinon, but the overall art of the film is nothing to scoff at. The music in the film is also a plus, much like the original series as well. The art/sound of SAO have been my two biggest praises for it, and it shows that A-1 does a good job with music production and art, despite them shelling out many stinkers, but that's a story for another day. There is an English dub for this film, however I haven't watched it as the dub for the original story I just felt was okay at best. Aniplex has given us good dubs in the past, but this is probably their weakest dub they've ever put out in my opinion. Still, it's passable.
Overall: SAO Ordinal Scale does have it's flaws, but I found it to be a surprisingly enjoyable and entertaining film on a whole. It reminds me of what I liked about SAO in the first place while also avoiding a decent chunk of the series's pitfalls along the way. Now come the ultimate question: Should you watch it? Well let me throw out another question for you: Did you like or enjoy anything about SAO? If the answer to that question is yes, then you'll find plenty to like here. Otherwise, it might not win many haters into the series. Still, I found it to be a pretty good film, and I'd recommend watching it after the first two seasons of the original show.
Rating: B (Mild Recommendation to Stream)
It is available to watch on Hulu in both sub and dub if you happen to have access to it. Have fun!",Positif
"Story 10/10
Okay, This Movie of Sword Art Online was decently good and quite enjoyable to watch. I like the story line and how it was executed. Character development wasn't needed. It didn't feel bland and brought up my excitements.
Art 10/10
As always, Sword Art Online with the amazing Animation and Art. It looks super fresh, I love it. It's almost like Alicization but not. It's well made.
Sound 9/10
The soundtracks of this Movie was Insane. The details to the sounds are amazing. Voice acting well done.
Character 10/10
Characters all had a purpose. I'm glad to see Asuna and Kirito in this Anime. Even the new characters look good
and well made.
Enjoyment 10/10
Yes, I enjoyed this Movie. Feel free to roast me on my profile. I found it Interesting and enjoyable. I'm looking forward for more of Sword Art Online for sure! One of my favorites.
Overall 10/10",Positif
"7 The story was great. The only problem that I had with it was the ending. Just that part should not have happened and could be changed for the better. It was just like the ending of the first part of SAO but with some minor differences.
8 The art was the same with the anime and was polished more by the studio so I liked it a lot.
I do not care much about sound so I would say it is all right.
7 The characters were great but in the ending it felt cringe full and forced and could of been changed to be better.
I
enjoyed overall and thought it was an great anime movie.",Positif
"As being a big fan of the first two seasons, I was extremely excited to watch this and it did not disappoint.
I believe the film played on some strengths from the previous seasons of the anime and brought in a couple of new original ideas to make its own unique story.
I thought it was really interesting how it grounded our character Kirito in the real world compared to the ultimate Kirito we had seen throughout the seasons, it was a side I don't believe we had seen much before - only briefly shown in the middle of the first season. This brought a new light
to the character with the new technology brought in - which I would like to say seems like quite a natural evolution from full dive technology. Seeing this side of Kirito made it feel even more satisfying later on seeing the Kirito we remember - 'The Blackswordsman' - fighting at his full strength.
The new technology did seem relevant in a way too, being kind of similar to Pokemon GO which was relatively new upon release and is still fairly popular.
Other themes I enjoyed derived from the memories characters had from SAO. Kirito wanted to experience it again as well as the others shown their excitement when faced with the features of the new technology. Also it explored characters in which had very traumatic experiences from SAO. From this the film did question whether the memories were traumatic or enjoyable. This combination of the two made an enticing story.
For me I always found that Sword Art had an amazing ability to create very unlikable villains in which I believe they succeed once again while bringing a being able to emphasis with them. I would have liked to seen them more fleshed out but I believe it was done well and being able to understand their motives.
Interestingly, the film showed negatives of SAO from both the inside and outside perceptive from which we had not seen before especially from the outside. Personally, I did find myself feeling empathy for the antagonists which a good film should be able to do rather than use two-dimensional bad guys. SAO being very developed with the protagonists should aim to do more of this.
Another comment I must make is the extraordinary visuals. This was by far on of the best looking animes I have seen. Clearly a lot of work went into this.
A reason why I do not believe this was a perfect movie was the fact that there is many characters that are not very developed and they were placed on the sidelines again. The story focused mainly on Asuna and Kirito, while they are generally the favourites, I simply think it is a missed opportunity to bring new light to other characters.
I found the pacing of the film at the beginning was a little slow also. I am not sure this was done on purpose to show some realism with the characters all being in the real world or was simply was done in order to align the story correctly.
Finally, I did thoroughly enjoy seeing themes from the first season and developing upon the world we thought we knew very well - it was done very well but I cannot help but to feel it could be have been done in another way. Using the SAO game as the foundations of the story for the main arc may not be necessary but instead introduce something else and perhaps use a side arc to bring elements of the original SAO. I just believe it was perhaps just a missed opportunity to do something new the universe we already know.
Sword Art Online Movie: Ordinal Scale was a great movie and I would highly recommend. It played all of Sword Arts strengths and worked well, the fight scenes in particular were excellent. I enjoyed seeing a multi-dimensional villain while it could have been developed a little further. The characters were done excellently and using their memories to create an interesting story.
While I did write some criticism as I believe there was some missed opportunities; however, the film was great and I cannot wait to see more in the future.",Positif

[IN-DEPTH REVIEW WITH SPOILERS]
Story: 8/10
Honestly, I think this story arc in SAO is one of the best ones of the entire series thus far. Reminder that SAO no longer is about the original game, but rather the residual effects of the game on the populace as well as the impact of the technology presented by the Nerve Gear. In Ordinal Scale, we get to see a knew type of technology emerging. While
VR was populated by the infamous Nerve Gear and the later Amusphere, a new type of technology called augmented reality (AR) has the Augma. The Augma allows people to have remote access to the internet and other features offered by the technology while still being conscious and able to see the world around you. The go-to game in the Augma is Ordinal Scale, which is a fantasy fighting game that's kind of like a combination of GGO and SAO in terms of gear and monsters. Events in the game happen in real life. The device allows you to see the monsters and attack them, but you have to move with your physical body. It's like a high-endurance, high-tech version of Pokemon GO (with being able to play IRL) combined with the current day VR, but 10x better.
Of course, we're back with everyone's favorite Gary Stu, Kirito, who is obviously not fond of AR, mostly because he's not used to actually having to move to play the game lmao. However, Kirito's suspicions are proved to actually be worth something when SAO survivors who play the game start losing their memories after dropping to 0 hp during an Ordinal event. It gets personal when Rank #2 player Eiji starts targeting his friends like the Furenkazan guild and Asuna (don't touch Kirito's woman). We get a lot of good things in this movie. We get cool fights which aren't as flashy as in previous games because this is still real life, so none of that fancy ""I can jump 16 stories high"" type stuff. Though there is still some questionable physics. Like Eiji's assistance equipment suddenly made him an acrobat AND the Flash, as well as Kirito jumping from a balcony (?) in the stadium and crashing into a bunch of seats where he somehow DIDN'T break at least 3 bones. But hey, anime doesn't have to be realistic. And it looked cool.
We get a great evil plot here that has a weirdly wholesome (eh, that's not a good word for it but whatever) motive. All Mr. BBEG wants is to see his daughter again. And our poor Eiji wants that too, unfortunately he gets double crossed in the end which is sad for him. The fight scene at the end is SUPER epic, too. Honestly, we still get a little bit of Gary Stu-ing, but it seems Kirito's Gary Stu aspect decreases the farther he strays from the original SAO. He gains strength in Ordinal by working his ass off, of course assisted with his prior knowledge of the bosses he was fighting. He only wins the final fight because Yui is a literal GODSEND and brings backup (they certainly would have failed if it was just them, even with Asuna). I like that they bring back minor characters like Sakura and Siune. Honestly, the last battle was so good, I started tearing up a little. And then full on crying when Asuna used Yuuki's Mother's Rosario and her apparition appeared with her.
Lastly, our token romance between Kirito and Asuna was a lot more tolerable in this movie. They get more tolerable as the series goes on, maybe because it's not as weird with them being all sappy and cringe if they're already in an established relationship. It was mega weird when they literally only knew each other well for a grand total of 3 days and were like ""let's get married"" (it was probably more than 3 days but with the strange pacing and time skipping in that first arc, it felt like it was that short). Knowing they've been together for over 2 years (probs been dating for at least 3) makes them being so important to one another much more reasonable and not just ""pretty girl has boobs and pretty boy has penis they be happy couple"".

Once again. IT'S. NOT. A. SWORD. ART. ONLINE. REVIEW. WITHOUT. A. 10/10. ART. SCORE. PERIOD.
Sound: 8/10
They never do badly with sound in SAO. Of course, it doesn't hit the same levels of hype as Crossing Field, and there's no OP/ED song that's really memorable. But the general soundtrack is great. Also, still quality dubs with Cherami Leigh and Bryce Papenbrook (one of the very few of his roles that I actually enjoy. He does Kirito quite well).
Characters: 8/10
I think the best character development we get in this is that Asuna actually has substance now. She was a great character for all of 6 episodes in the first arc, then was reduce to damsel in distress, and started to regain some sense of self in the Mother's Rosario arc. She gets time to be herself, goes to battles without Kirito, proves that she really is still a badass. Then she goes through a major struggle with the thought of losing her memories of Kirito. She reverts a little into her damsel in distress state for the middle of the movie, but this is understandable. The risk the Augma and Ordinal Scale presented to her health and memory were very scary for her, so all she really could do (especially with having lost an important part of her memory that could have helped with this) is leave the investigation of Augma to Kirito, Yui, and Kirito's government friends (perks of saving the lives of thousands of people I guess).
Kirito of course has his time in the spotlight. He struggles getting used to the Augma and pretty much gives up on it, prefering the effortlessness of VR over the physical limitations of AR (typical of a Gary Stu to be nothing without a system assist lmao). However, once Asuna and many others' lives are possibly at risk, he gets that admiral motivation and drive back. He doesn't just one shot a boss though. He actually trains (kind of) and works his ass off to become strong enough to beat Eiji (who is, ironically using a system assist that defies the laws of physics and still gets his ass beat by a Gary Stu who doesn't have their usual system assist). He has his god-mode moment that I saw some people complain about, but that could easily be explained by the way Ordinal Scale works. Kirito became the Rank #1 player, after having defeated Rank #2 Eiji and surpassed Rank #1 Yuna by beating the 100th floor boss. Yuna's father and Kayaba both said that based on the system of using ordinal numbers (rather than the cardinal number system SAO, ALO, and the Seed were created on), whoever became Rank #1 would be immortal - basically become god in that game. So Kirito going god-mode and killing all the monsters by himself in that last scene is reasonable. Surprisingly, Gary Stu doesn't Gary Stu is way out of this one.
And of course, we can't forget our bad guys + Yuna. Poor Yuna literally didn't ask for this. All her dad and Eiji really wanted was to see Yuna again. It's just the lengths her father would go are astounding. He'd kill a whole stadium's worth of people just to bring back one girl (and what if his plan didn't work like he thought, then he'd just have killed thousands of people needlessly). Eiji just wanted to see Yuna again. He felt at fault for letting her die because he wasn't strong enough to save her. Unfortunately, he wasn't told the whole plan and was double crossed. I would assume he didn't know about the high density scan that could possibly kill people. It's a shame that Yuna couldn't just go to Eiji instead of Kirito and be like ""bitch I don't want this"". He'd probably listen to her, if he really loved her. Just kind of sad for him that he didn't get to see her one last time. Y'know, for the closure.
Enjoyment: 9/10
This movie was SO satisfying to watch. It's probably one of the best written arcs of SAO to date. And the ending was so fabulous. When I say I cried during the final battle, I did in fact cry like a baby back bitch.
Overall: 8.6/10
This is my highest rating for all of the SAO arcs that involve Kirito (we aren't including the alternate which got an 8.8). This is also the highest rated season of any show I've watched since I started using this site. Of course, I've only rated about 8 seasons of multiple different shows, but my lowest rating was a 3.8 so you can tell how that's gone so far. But either way, this is a great movie. I swear, the SAO franchise's writing only gets better as the series goes on.",Positif
"After finishing SAO II, I was obliged to watch the Ordinal Scale movie, and to be frank, I was quite impressed. The movie carries on from season 2, so if you haven't watched that, I'd recommend going there first.
The SAO : OS movie's plot isn't too complicated. With Kirito basically being the hero and saving everyone from harm's way, like he does every time. The character's were the same, not really that much character development except for a little between Asuna and Kirito. As I continue watching the SAO series, I start to see Kirito getting insanely overpowered that it's too much for me to
handle.
Whilst the story was easily understandable, I found the animation to be the highlight and best thing from the movie. The animation was so clean and refreshing to see the amount of time put in the choreography of the boss fights, and the vibrant colours as you see swords clash.
Furthermore, I liked how they portrayed the end boss battle with everyone from the SAO series, and even paid tribute to Konno Yuuki when Asuna was about to unleash her sword skill - that was a job well-done!
Throughout the SAO series, the anime has provided me with great music from LiSA and Eir Aoi, and as always, the music was of a high standard. Especially LiSA's end song - that one was yet another banger!
Overall, I found this to be a very good movie, and despite it being 2 hours long, it's definitely worthwhile. 8/10.",Positif
"I swear to God, this fandom knows no peace of mind.
With the release of the first season, the entire industry has known a massive uphold for how successful and widely spread the franchise has gotten, but then, people who just hate what's mainstream and popular, but then, season two was released, and even within the fans of the first one, the surge was still strong and present, but this time it was due to disappointment if anything, and just after everybody thought it wouldn't get any worse, GGO was released, diving the fandom once more. There was no hope left for this franchise from an
outside perspective, but then, something came up, declaring the return of SAO with promising hights, sough by many like the second coming of Jesus (AS), the movie adaptation of the Ordinal Scale arc.
- Story (7.6/10):
With the release of the NerveGear, and the follow-up Amusphere, full-dive accessibility was as widely spread as smartphones are, these things were everywhere, every time, until a new technology slipped though, stealing all the spotlights, the Augma, move all the fuss and buzz from Virtual Reality to Augmented Reality, it seems, as these gadgets get smaller, the world and applications get much bigger. The inclusion of such a device was suddenly dropped it felt like it comes out from nothing, a typical decision to make after your boss pats your back violently, am I right Kawahara? (for the curious, Mr. Reki Kawahara is SAO's writer).
The move from VR to AR was very present and hard felt in the movie, looking at how Kirito and folks rely on system assists in the virtual world, physical genuinely was out of the question, but here, you can see the struggle. Kirito is by no mean the fit sports dude, so seeing him struggle was a nice touch.
The themes of the plot connected a lot with the Aincrad arc, it brought back the fun, the sad, and the sought past of what happened during the 2 years ordeal that was SAO, it also picked up a lot of talks and provoked many philosophical questions, what really makes a person, is it the memories you have with them? Is it their consciousness? Is it the impact they had on the world? Deep stuff that makes you think.
- Art (8.2/10):
Well, I guess, it's a movie, and a recent one at that, so we're home, or at least, your eyes are. Beautiful choreography like nothing we've seen before in SAO, the magic of a higher budget was definitely felt strongly.
CGI was used heavily, but for the sake of the settings, that would be batted off. The characters felt the same more or less, but I still couldn't shake the difference in Kirito and Asuna, both appear to look a bit more mature, probably due to the slight changes of the art style, or perhaps, it's the weird nose shine thingy.
- Sound (7.7/10):
I would stand on the average side when it's the audio department, I felt like the simple fact of bringing on some of the old openings would have upped this one a notch, but no. The featured songs, seeing how all of one of the key characters does is sing were good for their moment, and that's it.
The voice acting brought nothing new to the table, just some generic yelling and screams all over the place, enough to keep conversations going.
- Character (7.6/10):
To be honest, it's the old “easy come easy go” fiasco all over again. A better way to put it, it's was almost a carbon copy of the Mother's Rosario arc, having an arc revolve around a certain one-off character to motivate the cast to act and react. If anything, Asuna and Kirito's moments were the highlights here, seeing how there was a big theme around memories and what makes one him or herself.
Eiji as an antagonist was a bit weak and uninteresting, although, he did provide Kirito a hard opponent to stand against, the same goes for the man behind Augma felt like a bootleg helpless knockoff of Akihiko Kayaba, he started off the controversy, but did little as nothing to spice it out.
- Enjoyment (8.3/10):
The enclosed story, the tides to Aincrad were strong and what made the most of this movie, and the action sequences were definitely a highlight.
More fan service from the movie, both in a cultured way with a certain bath scene and in the battle sequences. Even for me, I've just seen SAO for the first time in under 10 days ago, yet, the movie was hitting on the right wave for me to make me feel nostalgic as though years have passed or something.
- Overall (7.88/10):
Some people would call this a comeback, just the right comeback for the franchise if you will. I would easily recommend this to anyone wishful enough for the return of SAO, just like it says at the last second of the movie while flashing on the screen; “SAO will return”.
Definitely the tribute the franchise deserves, pack it up, get something to eat, get comfy, it's going to be a lengthy movie, and oh, heads up, there is a nude scene in there, so be cautious while diving in.",Positif
"Well this one franchise I never thought I would give a positive rating. Let’s dive into the new SAO movie: Ordinal Scale.
The plot is much better handled than it was in the original. In the original, the issue with the plot was that it’s focus on Kirito and his complete badassery. We already know he’s going to win the fights, it’s only a matter of how. I was never worried that he would lose any significant fights, given his badassery. While this is nothing new, it makes SAO's battles seem overly dramatic. The movie on the other hand, focuses on how the game created bonds
between the SAO players and its weight. It’s about Kirito having to fight against personal loss, something much more interesting for a character of his archetype. It also suits the setting much more. The game becomes much more serious and personal rather than being just another game for Kirito to win. It can focus on the game being a legitimate and epic struggle for our heros. It also helps that Kirito doesn’t start out as an op edgleord in this AR world, being the unfit gamer he is. If you have seen either/both SAO seasons, the main plot will nothing new. There are quite a few humorous moments throughout the movie. The ending is also quite fantastic. You don’t need to have watched the previous seasons of SAO to get them but it helps. Also make sure to stay for that juicy after credit scene.
Characters:
The main gang form SAO seasons one and two make up the majority of the cast in this movie. Kirito, Asuna, Sillica, Liz, Sinon, Klien,Suguha and Yui are all very much the same people they were in their respective seasons. However, with the focus of the movie being actual survival in this game, the characters are much more digestible. Asuna is the badass she was at the beginning of SAO S1 throughout the whole film. The new individuals in this movie are Eji, Yuuna, and Tetsuhiro. Eji and Tetsuhiro serve as our new antagonists. Their motivations are actually reasonable and logical, unlike kayaba's. Yuuna is our new idol girl, looking and sounding fantastic.
Sound:
This new movie does introduce a few new pieces by the returning Yuki and the new Lisa. Yuki Kardra’s pieces are reminiscent of her work in Fate Zero. Lisa's song ""catch the moment"" is a real treat.
Animation:
The animation is quite magnificent as expected from SAO. I saw it on the big screen and it looked amazing. Incredible detail and colorful palates illustrate every frame.
Enjoyment/overall:
I enjoyed this film quite a bit. It is a good step up from its predecessors in the franchise. It’s SAO done right without unnecessary or unrealistic drama. I’d recommend it to anyone who watched SAO. If it sounds like I’m calling this a masterpiece, you are mistaken. It still has all the same flaws that the original SAO had from the shallow and predictable plot to the straightforward characters. That being said, it still definitely worth watching due to the improvements in how the intricacies of the plot are handled and the grand spectacle it presents. You also don’t need to watch the first two series to enjoy this film. I give the movie an 8/10(3 points better than the first season of SAO).",Positif
"""Children of the sun,
See your time has just begun,
Searching for your way,
Through adventures every day""
For many of us older fans, especially those of us who were kids back in the early 80s, these opening lines represented half an hour of pure, almost magical, adventure, the likes of which we hadn't had access to on a regular basis. I was one of the many, many children who would run home from school, throw my bag on the floor, turn on the TV, and be transported to South America in 1532 for a while.
The Mysterious Cities of Gold was, to myself and many others, the show
that got us hooked on a type of cartoon that we would ultimately know as anime. No longer would I be satisfied with the violent antics of mouse, cat, canary, rabbit, or bald hunter et al. Nevermore would the yappings of an overgrown mutt and his hippy companions satisfy my need for mystery. Outcast were the incessant wranglings of families both past and future. This anime effectively reshaped my concept of what made a good cartoon, and it's effects on myself and others has been lasting.
Okay, intro over, lets get to the nitty gritty.
The MYsterious Cities of Gold (or MCoG as it seems to be known now), is one of those rare gems that only come around once every few years. The story was written byJean Chalopin and Bernard Deyriès, and is very loosely based on the novel ""The King's Fifth"" by Scott O'Dell. Some of you may recognise the name of Jean Chalopin as the creative genius who also brought us Ulysses 31, Inspector Gadget, Pole Position, Rainbow Brite, M.A.S.K., Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, and a number of other cartoons. MCoG is considered to be his greatest work, seconded only by Ulysses 31.
The series is about a young spanish boy named Esteban, an orphan boy who was rescued at sea, and is now considered to be the ""Child of the Sun"" by the people of Barcelona. He joins the Spanish exploration of the ""New World"" in an effort to find the Seven Cities of Gold and, hopefully, his father. On his travels he meets two other children, Zia and Tau, who accompany him on his journey.
I'm going to stop there as even though the series is 39 episodes long, this is an adventure that shouldn't really be spoiled in any way.
The plot and pacing in almost every episode is, quite simply, astounding. The depth of the story, and the skill with which Jean Chalopin and Bernard Deyriès have written each episode, has resulted in a series that has almost no filler, and that drives the story forward with almost every episode. Only a few series can make a similar claim and, sadly, only a very few of those are from the last few years.
Given that the series is as old as it is there are many out there who will be put off by the fact that the character designs appear dated, and that the animation isn't as smooth as todays standards. That said, the show is still very well done, and although it very clearly shows its age in many places, these are nowhere near enough to deter one from what is a captivating story.
One area where the series excels, even by todays standards, is in it's creative, and sometimes inspired, music. When watching this show one should keep an ear open for the differences in thematic music, especially with regards to each character. The music throughout the series reflects the South American (more Peruvian than Brazilian though), and Spanish themes upon which the story is based, and although much of it was done using synthesizers, the effect is still laudable for the little touches of authenticity the music brings to each character or scene. In addition to the thematic music, the OP is one of the catchiest in anime, and it may come as a surprise when you find yourself whistling or humming it for days after.
The dubs are both very good as well. There are critics of the English dub, however I feel that this is unjustified. The English dub was far more ambitious than most people realise as, rather than simply enacting a ""literal"" translation, the actors were encouraged to add their own depth and vitality to each role. This is why the English dub is sometimes very different to what appears in the Japanese dub, even though the characters are still, effectively, saying the same things.
Many viewers who become hooked on the show will remember the giant golden condor, the submarine, or even Kokapetl (the parrot), however all will tell you that the reason they kept watching was because of the characters. MCoG has several key characters, with the main ones being Esteban, Zia, Tau and Mendoza. Add to them Mendoza's bumbling mercenaries Sancho and Pedro, Pizarro, Gaspard, Gomez, and a whole host of other characters, many of whom appear only sporadically, and you have quite a large list to go through.
It would be very easy for a series to get lost in the wealth of it's characters, however MCoG not only avoids this, but pulls off some of the most amazing development of both on and off screen characters that can be seen in anime. Esteban, Zia and Tau are literally driven to develop as characters, with Esteban in particular being forced to make some tough choices. One would think this means the show waxes melodramatic, yet the series never really slips into this, and manages to test the characters in ways not seen in anime or cartoons at the time. Even now, there are very few shows that will force the characters to think and act, rather than react and/or use strength and willpower alone.
Possibly the real star of the show though, is Mendoza. The Spaniard is an expert sailor and navigator, and is more than skilled with a sword. He is also very much a strategist, and there are numerous occasions when he thinks his way out of situations. Not only that, when he is off screen the viewer has an absolute certainty that he is not resting on his laurels, but is planning or acting somewhere to achieve his sometimes ambiguous goals. Anime in the 80s had not seen a character like him before, and this type of characterisation is still a rarity. The most recent example of a character of Mendoza's type that I can think of is Satoshi Batista from Michiko to Hatchin (which, ironically enough, is also set in a quasi-South American world).
As far as adventures go, MCoG is one of the best, if not the best, out there. Given the fact that the series is over 25 years old it would be easy to think that I'm simply making this comment out of nostalgia or a sense of reminiscence. I'm not. I've just finished watching the DVD collection (a gift from someone who likes me a lot), and to say it puts almost every adventure based anime out there to shame would not be an understatement. MCoG set the standard for adventure anime, and it's a sad fact that these standards have not been maintained.
I have enjoyed this series as a child and as a man, and it is one of only a handful of shows that I would watch in my dotage. There was, and still is, a sense of realism from the characters that most anime would envy, and I consider this series to be one of the most underrated classics (and I do not use that term lightly), in anime to date. Fans of classic anime will not be disappointed, so if you're into Legend of Galactic Heros then this may be right up your street. Likewise those who want something adventurous, and that makes you want to get out there and explore the world, should definitely give this a try.
Don't be fooled by the dated look of the show. You're missing out otherwise.
Oh, and for those of you who, like me, are fans of the series - REJOICE! There is apparently a movie to be produced of the series, and three new seasons have also been announced. We shall have to wait and see if they can live up to the standards set by the original. I, for one, am looking forward to them.",Positif
"Ok, a little bit of a disclaimer before I start my review. I'll admit it - this review is highly biased in the sense that I'm a highly nostalgic person, and I am giving this anime such a high score mostly because of the great memories it gave me as a kid.
Mysterious Cities of Gold (MCoG) is a personal favourite of mine - a classic anime from yesteryear. A literal gold nugget that popped up admist the overflowing sludge that was children's television programming in general. As Indiana Jones would say: &quot;It belongs in a mueseum!&quot;
The problem with this anime is that if you
are watching MCoG for the first time you may end up thinking that this DOES actually belong in a mueseum and I can see how watching it today may present some obstacles in its enjoyment. To cut to the chase - this anime was made over 25 years ago and it has not aged well. On comparison to today's animation production standards the quality of the soundtrack ranges from average to downright bad (depending on what copy you get your hands on), the animation is mediocre at best, and the voice acting? Lets just say, avoid the English language version like the plague.
Now if you're a nostalgic old coot like myself who is looking to recover a long lost treasure from childhood these shortcomings probably won't be much of a problem - you see nostalgia tends to blind you to such deficiencies. You'll sit back on your rocking chair and start thinking: &quot;Now, back in my day...&quot;
My guess is though that there is a fairly high chance that you may not be a cantankerous old git like myself. You may well be full of pluck, used to anime with high-octane thrills, visceral explosions with a pumping soundtrack in the background, ala Tengen Toppa Gurren Laggan. If you are, I have to tell you in advance: despite the high score I have given to this, you MAY not get into this. You have been warned.
Now that that little disclaimer is over and done with, lets get down to why this show remains one of my favourite television shows, and why it will probably remain with me for the rest of my life.
Now I said earlier that MCoG has rather bad production values compared with a lot of material that is getting released today. You have to remember though, that at the time of its release this anime literally blew the competition away and reshaped the concept of what makes for a good animation both for myself personally as a kid growing up, but also for the animation industry as a whole. It's kind of funny to say this, but as a kid I never really 'got into' cartoon shows aimed at kids. I never really liked Disney or Warner Brothers cartoons - even as a kid they seemed pretty lame, and I hated it how the animators of these shows just assumed that kids wouldn't get into a cartoon with a deeper undertone. It was like they were making cartoons just to get you to shut the fuck up while Mum cooked the tea.
Then along came the Mysterious Cities of Gold - my first introduction the world of anime, and a cartoon with a riveting, exciting and at times highly emotional story.
Picture this. A wide eyed child of about 5 years old sits down with a bowl of ice cream and turns on the TV. The kid hopes like hell that he wouldn't get the fucking Roger Ramjet theme blare at him again. Silence... This could just be his lucky day...
A shot then starts to progressively cut in to South America and its temples from the far reaches of the galaxy while a man's voice booms:
&quot;It is the 16th century, from all over Europe great ships sail west to conquer the New World, the Americas&quot;
&quot;The men eager to seek their fortune, to find new adventures in new lands&quot;
&quot;They long to cross uncharted seas and discover unknown countries&quot;
&quot;To find secret gold on a mountain trail high in the Andes&quot;
&quot;They dream of following the path of the setting sun that leads to El Dorado,&quot;
&quot;And the MYSTERIOUS CITIES OF GOLD...&quot;
20 minutes pass and the show ends. The kid's ice cream, long since forgotten about, lies melted beside him untouched...
Now that's what I'm talking about! Finally there was a children's show that treated kids to something worth watching. The premise of it all - An adventure story with an intriguing, emotive plot and characters whose intentions were not always clear - finally a show that made you want to rush home from school and turn on the telly - it's all in the story. Yes MCoG is a children's show, but the story, setting and characters are so well done that I believe it can be enjoyed equally by adults - or, 'big kids at heart', much in the same way an adult may enjoy a Miyazaki film.
No, MCoG doesn't feature the pumping soundtrack, or the flashy visuals on offer as in the majority of anime today. But it does offer something extra, that little something that is so hard to define. The X-factor that separates a true classic from a passing fad. MCoG was and is so important for me personally because it was my very first encounter with 'classic' entertaiment - something deep and meaningful that sticks with you for years, decades later. I've seen a lot of other shows since then and I actually tend to like most of them, but I would have inevitably forgotten about them within a year or two. There is something about shows like MCoG and a handful of other 'classic' shows that makes them unforgettable entertainment. I can't guarantee that you'll get the same buzz that I got as a kid when I watched it all those years ago, but I can guarantee that you'll be watching a pioneering anime of the 80's, an eternal classic whose influence can be seen in a number of highly regarded anime of today's generation.",Positif
"I just want to open this one by saying I am completely biased.  I was ADDICTED to MCoG when I was a kid and as soon as it came out on DVD I bought the boxset and watched every episode back to back.  (Severely annoying several of my friends in the process.)
If you didn't catch this one back in the 80's then it might not hold the same magical charm for you that it holds for a lot of 80's kids, however with a remake on the horizon I think its long over due for a comeback.  I will admit here and
now that I have never watched the Japanese language version, so I can't speak for that one but I think MCoG still has it's place in the world.
The series has one long running story arc so it's not really possible to watch it out of order if you are completely unfamiliar with it.  However, for a kids show the story arc is well developed and much more than you would expect.
The show was an early experiment in 'edutainment' each episode ended with the voice over guy giving you some interesting facts about south america or whatever the theme of the episode was.  I almost enjoyed those bits as much as the main show itself.
The voice acting wasn't brilliant on the part of the kids, but since they were actually voiced by children I think we can forgive it of them.
I would recommend this show to anyone who wants to watch some good old fashioned adventure, anyone who likes long story arcs or anyone who just fancies watching it.  It's a great piece of nostalgia &amp; with a remake right around the corner its always good to see where things started.
I'll end this review here before I start signing the theme tune...",Positif
"Given that a lot of reviewers admit right off the base that it has nostalgic value for them, the first thing I'm going to say is that this show does not for me. I wasn't born until 1988 and I didn't even get cable until late 2001, I had no way to watch this show until hulu and DVD. So, this is a review from someone who did not have nostalgic factor involved as a disclaimer before I even start this. Now, onto the review!
I'll start with the weaker elements first, the animation did not age particularly well and the voice acting often comes across
as stiff. Now, it's pretty cool that they actually used kids to voice the kids, but they're not terribly good most of the time and not having a strict script resulted in saying way too much at certain times and having it come off rather stiff and forced a lot. I am thinking this is simply the era it was dubbed, I've heard other 80s cartoon dubs in my life before and a lot of them sound similar, like America did not learn how to dub well until the 90s. Robotech was a rare exception for me where I quite liked most of the voices and voice acting, so good acting has come out of the 80s, but I'm not going to say this was a particularly good dub. I did eventually get used to the voices, but certain animations on screen would cause a syndrome in which the characters would be forced to say incredibly obvious things like ""watch out for the rocks!"" while the rocks are already falling or make several characters obsess over the same event for way too many lines (""wow, I can't believe we dodged all those falling rocks! There were so many!"" ""Yeah, that was close!"" ""Is everyone ok?"" ""Yes, we're all ok! I'm glad none of us got hurt!"" ""So am I!""). I'm fairly sure a lot of these instances had to come from the animation itself, which was another thing that didn't necessarily age too well. The backgrounds look nice most of the time and for its time, it's actually pretty good, but fight scenes are pretty poorly animated and you can just see that a lot of animation was reused as the same guy climbs up a ladder right behind his identical twin. The animation really felt like it limited the series too me, I often felt that they had to write around it and came up with scenarios that required less animation.
The music is pretty nice, but certainly comes off as 80s sounding with some synthesizer stuff mixed in everywhere. You either like it or you don't, but it did fit the series pretty well.
But onto the actual reason for watching, the story and characters. Now, I'm not sure if this was a requirement of all 80s and 90s adventure type series, but there are several worthless characters who just tag along for what I can only imagine is to annoy the audience, and here we have two and a half, the two idiot Spaniards who's entire mission it is to almost kill everyone by being stupid and getting them in trouble and the most useful thing they do the entire series is find a cave behind a waterfall while spending the rest of it demanding gold and being useless and whiney and a little bird who is actually useful in warning of danger, but it's voice is just annoying as all hell. While I can forgive the bird (it is kinda the team pet), those two idiots are pretty much worthless to the point where their employer says so and these two are there the entire series while contributing nary a drop to the story or action and they're so annoying they can't pull off funny either.
For me, the best character was probably Mendolza, you could never quite tell who he was siding with, the side that gets the gold or the side that follows the kids on adventures, and it was interesting to second guess what he was going to do. Even after all this time, he still felt interesting, he did age well.
As for the kids themselves, they obviously are the main focus of the series here, well they tended to vary in how interesting they were. It would often depend on what the episode was focusing on, but for the most part, Tao stole the spotlight for me while Zia stood in the corner shouting ""Oh, Esteban!"" while being kidnapped or held at...sword point (I suppose you would call it) way too often (I'm assuming because of animation limits) in need of rescue. Esteban could be pretty interesting too, he showed he had some brains and did some clever and unexpected things, but he can't bargain with bad guys very well nor outsmart them. As soon as any given bad guy threatened Zia or Tao, he'd instantly give in to whatever there demands are. On the rare occasion he did manage to outsmart one, it was quite fun to watch. Oddly enough, the bad guys themselves weren't terribly smart, they often do the same stupid tactics and are easily fooled by falling rocks, they all just happened to be extremely good at capturing Zia and holder her at sword point. It only helped the bad guys that the animation forced a syndrome in which no one could look behind them to notice someone obviously about to kidnap Zia until she went ""Oh, Esteban, help!"" even when there were obviously bad guys in the room, all armed with swords, standing closest to Zia. I was unable to suspend my belief here when it happened almost once an episode.
But it all boils down to one thing for me: is this a good adventure series? And I would have to say that yes, it is. The locales were fun and imaginative while still being based in reality and some ridiculously unlikely dangerous thing was on the verge of happening every other second to spur the plot along (to quote family guy: ""and then he was attacked by a pots and pans robot!!"") and the episodes just flew by. Despite spending a bit too long talking about stupid stuff, a lot of stuff happened each episode, so pacing was fast. I liked it all until the sudden appearance of a certain group towards the end that just seemed out of place within the show, annoyingly, this group was there from that episode pretty much until the end of the series. It didn't ruin it, but it did annoy me at least.
If you can ignore things like animation, long winded scentences about what you already see happening, and some really stupid characters, it's still an enjoyable ride and most of it is pretty good. It was, however, overly predictable with the exception of Mendolza who could always be counted on to add a bit of spice to the show in any given situation. I'd still call it good, but would probably most recommend it to people who find nostalgia in it, like adventure shows a lot, like 80s shows, or are going to show it to a younger child, sibling, niece/nephew, etc. The educational segments at the end sometimes contain some mild nudity, but they really helped add to the world and were usually very interesting (a few sucked, maybe 4 out of 39).",Positif
"Yet another animated series I watched as a kid and had no idea it was to the most part made by Japanese people. Then again, it was so good to be made by any other country so that pretty much explains it. Technically, The Mysterious Cities of Gold (TMCOG) was the One Piece of anime back in the early 80’s. It is a children’s adventure regarding seeking treasure, discovering ancient civilizations, uncovering secrets, and occasionally using relics to fight their way through various challenges and opponents. It is partially based on actual history, the age of exploration during the charting of America, and even has
live-action documentary segments in the end of each episode that teach the children to the basic events that took place at that era. Thus it entertaining and educational at the same time, two elements that usually conflict with each other when it comes to animated shows. I sort of see it as a great combination of a historical documentary such as the journeys of Christopher Columbus with a classic fictional adventure full of action and suspense, such as Treasure Island. Although there actually are anime made about both those titles around the same time, none were as captivating as TMCOG because they both felt too basic.
Despite its age, the production values are not bad at all. Although the character figures look rather simply drawn and have minimal shading on them, their motions are usually very dynamic in terms of performance (not frames per second) so your eyes are kept busy looking at something all the time. I am even willing to say most modern anime shows have far less things going on in each scene compared to this oldie, thus tend to be far easier to be bored if all you look at is frozen caricatures with a flapping mouth. Also, since none of the characters has superpowers you are guaranteed an interesting event no matter how simple it may appear to be. Steering a ship or climbing a mountain tends to be a dangerous task and the series takes its time to show how they need to organize in order to do it right. Whole episodes are spent in just having the characters sailing or walking, while at the same time flavouring them as personalities and making the simplest thing they do to appear hard, dangerous, and meaningful.
Sadly, the above doesn’t stand true all the way and in the second half there is way too much super technology going around to water-down the feeling of adventure. The characters will simply use their medallions to unlock gates nobody else can or fly with an airplane (made in ancient times!) to complete any task in a few seconds. They make it seem so simple and rushed, it loses its initial importance.
Regarding the sound part, I never watched the series in the original Japanese or French dub; just in Greek as a kid and in English as an adult. In both cases I can’t say they were very impressive. In fact, I could say they felt very colourless, childish and simple but then again it is a show aimed at children so no worries here. The music themes are very nifty and they tend to be very memorable. They have tunes that make them sound like they are from native Central America and the lyrics are full of adventure-inspiring words; so I say they are successful at what they set out to do.
The story is simply amazing if you see it as a whole. It combines both historical facts, has lots of adventure and mystery, has lots of character interaction, has lots of excitement and above all HAS ALMOST NO FILLERS! The main three heroes are kids who seek to find something important in the Incan ruins (each one has different goals though) and are supported by a crew of explorers who simply want to find gold and get rich. So there is variety in the motivations of its characters, something which usually leads to internal conflicts. The themes are also changing from time to time so you are again not getting the same atmosphere in all the episodes. Some of them can be about adventure, others about pacifism, others about greed, and so on. Some of them event have science fiction in them which may feel out of context a bit (makes the Incas to appear like they had 20th century technology) but I guess it is excused in a children’s adventure and since we already have all those weird Nazka theories.
What may feel tiresome is how the action is almost always very basic and any conflict is resolved in a rather cop-out manner. It tends to get boring if you are sure the heroes will find a way to get out of any danger without ever getting hurt. Also, some parts will feel unnecessary long and the payback will be just something you knew all along that would happen. But as I said, waiting for those live action segments just to see how all that fit in the story was keeping me interested no matter what was happening.
The characters will feel rather basic and stereotypical but they definitely get some sort of development along the way and everybody is given enough focus for you to know and like. Although they are all very simple as personalities and act rather cartoony (extreme personal quirks or traits), they are all a colourful bunch and I liked them for what they are. We get the usual high-spirited kids, the greedy adventurers, the stupid megalomaniac villains, the vengeful natives, but thanks to the variable themes of the story, they definitely manage to grow on you.
It is without doubt one of the best animated retro adventures of all times and I recommend it to everyone who wants some good old fashion excitement regarding treasure hunting and exploration.
And now for some excused scorings.

"As a general rule, people usually forget what has come before.  For anime fans, particularly those who aren’t Japanese, this is all too often the case as new shows are hailed as the best ever, groundbreaking, or original while completely ignoring what influenced them in the first place.  Urusei Yatsura may not be (it's not) the greatest series in the history of anime but it ranks right up there in the top five most influential of all time.
Urusei Yatsura is the first of Rumiko Takahashi's work to receive an anime adaptation.  It centers on what is today a tried and
true anime concept, a beautiful alien girl, Lum, falls in love with a rather ordinary and none to bright boy, Ataru.  While this may or may not have been the first time this had ever been put to film, you can be sure this was the first time it was done so successfully and thus spawning decades of future imitators.  Add in a cast of gorgeous girls and other zany and outrageous characters and a memorably stupid and lecherous leading man, you have the framework for an amusing series.
However for modern fans a few things that are missing from the show will likely effect their overall enjoyment.  For starters, Urusei is almost a completely episodic anime with absolutely nothing in regards to an overriding storyline.  Once characters have been introduced into the series canon they change little if at all.  Because of the nature of this format it makes many of the episodes completely predictable and annoyingly repetitive.  A basic episode revolves around Ataru chasing girls, Lum becoming angry, followed by Lum electrocuting him.  Additionally quite a few characters are nauseatingly annoying or generally grate on your nerves and outstay their welcome.
All that being said, when Urusei Yatsura is good, it’s REALLY good.  But any viewer determined to take the leap into this series would be wise to savor it slowly over time.  Over the several years I spent watching this series I found a few episodes at a time was the best I could manage in any given sitting.  I would suggest that pace for anyone as well.  If you are interested at all in the history of anime, UY should be near the top of your list.  While most fans may not be familiar with most if not all of its characters, everyone is familiar with them as they live on today after being pioneered in this series.
The alien girl Lum remains today even thirty years later as one of the most iconic figures of anime.  It’s pretty much impossible to dislike Lum.  Most people think of her as a tsundere type character but she’s not.  Lum is honest with her feelings and incredibly jealous.  Add her electrocuting powers, she makes for a girl I don’t think any man with a brain would dare defy or cheat on.  Since Ataru is an idiot he doesn't ever learn though.  Despite her jealousy and frequent use of her power she never comes across as a bully or a bitch.  More often than not you find yourself feeling a little sorry for her that she has fallen for such an unfaithful and idiotic man.  Love is blind they say...
For Ataru, he is an unrepentant louse and womanizer in addition to being a complete idiot.  You might think that because of his personality that he would not be a likable character either but that’s not the case at all.  Despite his odious character defects he remains a charming and likable character throughout the series.  Whether you just like his antics or like watching him in pain or being punished.  While it becomes obvious that Ataru really does care for Lum, his womanizing and rejection of Lum's advances seem to be out of a desire to not be tied down or in liking being chased.  Even though he is completely and totally unsuccessful in wooing any woman other than Lum he never seems to give up.
The supporting cast is enormous, as one would expect from a series of this length.  The results are mixed.  Because many characters have extreme personalities I often found that they became annoying if they were featured too often.  Shinobu starts as Ataru's girlfriend and vies for his affections in the early parts of the series.  She is one of the rare exceptions to change over the course of the series.  I was glad to see her not pine over Ataru for the entire series though she took a rather strange turn from being an ordinary Japanese girl to being a super strong girl.  Mendou also shines as the super rich boy who is adored by all the girls, except the one he most wants (Lum).  But in actuality he is just as much of a womanizer as Ataru is.  He makes for an excellent foil.  Others like Jariten, Ran, and Megane are generally amusing but tend to get on your nerves if they get too much screen time.  Cherry and Ryuunosuke's father are ALWAYS annoying and generally made me swing from the desire to punch a hole through my television and projectile vomiting.
From an artistic standpoint, due to its success it’s likely to have influenced character designs for an entire generation and eventually lead to what we have today.  I think you can probably trace the origins of ""moe"" back to at least this series as the thin, lanky, and elegant body types of the 70's give way to younger, chubbier, and cuter looking ones.  Despite its age though and the peculiarities of animation from this era its still looks fabulous.  The characters are extremely expressive and have enough dissimilarity that they are easily distinguishable from each other, with only a few exceptions.
The seiyuu performances are first rate and each brings out their characters to perfection.  Whether it be Lum's anger or Ataru's perverted giggling you can’t help but be drawn into Urusei's universe.  The series features many different OP/ED themes that vary from your standard J-Poppy tunes that wouldn't be that out of place today and the very dated engrish disco tracks.  It’s old enough now that you may just have some 80s nostalgia.
I my opinion everyone should give this series a watch.  While it certainly isn't an easy viewing experience, getting through it will give you an appreciation for the history of animation in Japan and an insight on Japanese pop culture.  Not to mention it's also pretty damn funny.",Positif
"Back in my ""Maison Ikkoku"" review, I mentioned that it seems that fans have a tendency to neglect some of the old classics that made the creators they love big in the first place.  Either that or they turn a blind eye to them, seeing as they're ""old"".   I'll probably get some flack for all that, but it's just so prominent in today's anime fandom that the latest things out there are ""the best anime ever"" one day, and when ""one year later"" rolls its way by and/or when the series ends, it would be a thing of the past.
And the cycle
goes on and on.   This is the way everything in the media and life is unfortunately.  But there are still series out there that can still be remembered by the vetran anime fans and are held in high esteem as being influential to many manga artists (Like ""Dragonball"" for example.  Eiichiro Oda, one of the people influenced by DB went on to make ""One Piece"", which is freakishly popular in Japan), and ""Urusei Yatsura"" is no different.  Heck, reruns of it still play on Japanese primetime and the manga gets reprinted constantly!
The story is about Ataru Moroboshi, who, as normal as he looks, is the unluckiest and most girl-crazy being in the entire universe.  His mere existance attracts unnatural bad luck towards himself and the people around him.
But one day, Ataru comes home to see that the leader of a race of alien oni is sitting in his  house.  It turns out that he has been randomly selected by computer to race in the major sport of the Oni's planet: the game of tag.   He's challenged to race the leader's daughter, the beautiful, tiger bikini-clad Lum.  Ataru has to chase Lum for ten days and grab her horns, or else the race of Oni aliens will take over Earth.
This seems easy to Ataru at first...that is, until he finds that Lum can fly, taking the difficulty level way higher than he expected.  On the night before the last day, Ataru's childhood friend Shinobu promises to marry him if he is able to win.  Full of a new burst of confidence, Ataru grabs Lum's horns in the final minutes of the game and shouts, ""NOW I CAN MARRY HER!!""  Unfortunately, Lum misunderstands what he means and takes his victory cry as a marraige proposal to her, which she accepts promptly and starts calling him ""Darling"".
At first UY may seem like another ""Love Hina"" type of anime, where the show lives to only show fan service and nudity.  Other then some little things and unexplicit nudity, the show's pretty clean, depending on which episode it is (there's only two I know of that featured nudity), but seeing the art quality and film quality making them look less detailed, I doub it'll infect anyone.  Other than that, it's nothing else than what you would see on BayWatch: four alien chicks in bikinis.
Though it's definitely a good example of 80s anime.   Sure, it's incredibly cheezy and the kind of funny that makes you laugh because of how dumb (in a good way) the show is, but it plays like a dream.
Another thing I might want to bring up is that some sites cite this series as a ""harem anime"".  Sure, there's a bunch of women in it and a central male loser character, but keep in mind that most of the women in UY hate Ataru.  Despite his barely controlable libido, Lum loves him no matter what.  D'awwwww.
The story is very lighthearted and wacky, with all sorts of bizzare references to Japanese mythology and cheesy puns on the language.   The artwork is colorful and very cartoon-esqué, but the main target that the show wants is plain fun.   It creates a happy mood for the viewers and freely takes you on a random and crazy ride through all the characters.
""Urusei Yatsura"" has probably one of the biggest casts out of Rumiko's other stories (next to ""Ranma 1/2"").  We have Lum's fire-breathing cousin Ten, who hates Ataru with a purple passion and will do whatever it takes to make Ataru look bad, Ran, a redheaded alien with a split personality, the noble Oyuki, the motorbiking Benten, and an assortment of many other weird monsters and aleins.
There's a good balance of humans too, like Shinobu, who can come across as  sincere but can get so angry that she's able to lift ridiculously heavy objects and throw them,  Lum's fanclub at Tomobiki High, consisting of a bunch of nerds that are ready to reprehend Ataru if he commits a misdeed related to Lum, Ryuunosuke, a girl raised to be a boy by her sexist father, the rich and handsome Shuutaro Mendou, and Ataru's (REALLY) whiney parents who do hardly anything but mourn that the wish they never had Ataru.
Take all these characters and put them in a regular environment, and it's one wacky romance-comedy thoughout all 195 TV episodes, 4 movies, and 6 OVAs.
But one thing that can strike someone funny is Ataru's character.  He's a far cry from the meek yet determined Yusaku Godai, and Ranma Saotome and Inuyasha, who are characterized with bravery and great fighting skills.
However, as much of an idiot and a pervert that Ataru makes himself out to be, he's actually a very caring person, and an intelligent one at that.  His legendary bad luck and resistence to injury has convinced him to be otherwise  and that's the reason why he acts the way he does.  And as much as he dismisses it, he truly loves Lum as much as she loves him.
With a strong amount of sotries and characters, along with loads of laughs and catchy songs and BGM, ""Urusei Yatsura"" is an anime that is particularly hard series to get bored of.",Positif
"Urusei Yatsura (Those obnoxious aliens) was an extremely popular manga and anime series that ran in Japan in the early 80s. Lately, people have been forgetting about these wonderful classics, and so I figured I'd write a review on one that I really enjoyed watching years and years ago, Urusei Yatsura. Urusei Yatsura is Rumiko Takahashi's first work to receive an anime adaptation (ahead of other classics such as Maison Ikkoku, Ranma and Inuyasha). Needless to say, Urusei Yatsura is a true classic that opened the way for future rom-com anime, and all the meanwhile is a wonderful-highly enjoyable story.
The basic outline of the story
will seem really stupid, childish, cheesy, boring and ""unorignal"" at first. But if you take into account that this story was written over 30 years ago, then you'll realize that it was the birthmark of similar stories. And if you compare the anime solely to modern-day shows, then perhaps it won't be one of the best shows you've come across, but Urusei Yatsura set the stone down for these new shows that you enjoy to be created.
Urusei Yatsura is the comedic story of the tumultuous relationship between the Beautiful tigerskin-bikini-clad alien princess, Lum, and the Earth's most lecherous boy, Ataru Moroboshi. Ataru is a pervert whose constantly trying to  chase other girls around and Lum has to continuously bring him back into line with her raging jealous temper and tremendous jolts of electricity. But the story goes far beyond that. Urusei Yatsura covers nearly all genres, from romance to science fiction to comedy to parody to Japanese mythology to psychological. Urusei Yatsura incorporates it all into a wonderful, enjoyable story. The outline of the story is basically: The alien race is about to take over Earth, but in order to save the human race, a deal was made between the aliens and the humans. In a race, if a human [Ataru] can touch the Alien representative's horn in a race, then Earth will be saved. At first Ataru doesn't want to do the deal, and would rather have the human race extinct than actually do something he doesn't want to do... But that all changes when he sees that the Alien representative is a beautiful girl - Lum. With the idea of actually being encouraged to grab and grope the beautiful alien to reach her horns, Ataru eagerly does the race and succeeds - thanks to Shinabu, Ataru's one true love who promise to marry Ataru if he succeeded. Upon touching Lum's horns, Ataru yells in glory ""I can get married"", which causes Lum to misunderstand - thinking Ataru wants to marry her, and so the entire 175 episodes of the story begins.
If you're looking to watch a series that intertwines many side events into one large main event, and the story is connected, then this isn't exactly the place to look. The episodes are episodic, and it jumps around all over the place. The story is honestly really random, and at times makes absolutely no sense. But so what? It was always enjoyable and hilarious to watch Ataru try to run away from Lum, Lum chase him down and a whole load of bizarre events unfold. I've seen people compare this show to the Simpsons in terms of how weird and unorderly the story is, but I'd say they have nearly nothing alike. 175 episodes of 1980s comedy-romance, how lovely right?
The show can be characterized as character-driven, because there is no real plot. There is only characters that create a story each episode because of their love/hatred/annoyance/misunderstanding of each other. The characters are the epitome of your average stereotypical characters. Ataru being the super annoying pervert that he is. Lum being that jealous girl who doesn't want any other girl to be near the guy she loves. And blah blah blah, a whole buttload of other side characters who take their part in the large scheme of things, and then suddenly leave/disappear at some random time because the writers can do that kind of stuff. Throughout the long course of 175 episodes, Ataru and Lum's characters develop a lot-lot, and the audience starts to adjust to their characters, and instead of having a feeling of annoyance towards the characters, the audience develops a sense of bond-love-friendship-understanding with the characters which keeps the entire story not only funny, but captivating and memorable. Sure, Ataru is a pervert who is running away from a innocent, beautiful girl who purely/solely loves him. At first the audience wants him to love Lum back because Lum is so beautiful and innocent, but from Ataru's perverted point of view, why should he love someone if he doesn't actually love her? And Lum... Oh Lum, why must you always shock the poor boy just because he doesn't love you back? It's all just a misunderstanding. Stop stalking Ataru. But over the longass time of 175 episodes, all those thoughts suddenly change-evolve into something like: I love you all. All characters in Urusei Yatsura are annoying at times (like really annoying), but that helps develop their characters into characters that the audience can relate with and like - learn from their annoyance/mistakes. 175 is a lot of episodes. Yes, there are some filler-episodes that help define a character, and yes they can be quite boring at times, but that's the 1980's - long-running series for you. If the load of episodes, turns you off from the show, then poor you, that's your loss. Urusei Yatsura has a quite cast of characters throughout the 175 episodes that you should definitely watch.
The sound and art of the show was composed/drawn in the 1980s, so it's unfair to compare it to romance-comedy-supernatural stories of today. But compare to other shows of it's time, Urusei Yatsura's art is spectacular, and the music isn't great, but isn't bad either. The music of Urusei Yatsura is more of the cute-innocent girly girl yet has a supernatural-alien pinch of sauce style. Especially the opening which is basically a high-pitched girl's voice squeaking, but it's not like an annoying squeaking sound, but more of a cute love sound. There aren't many times in the show (despite being 175 episodes) where music, soundtrack is being played during the show. The character's voicings were wondrous, I loved them, and normally I'm not a big fan of character's voices in romance stories. The character's designs were drawn up by the great, Akemi Takada who also drew the character's for the great Maison Ikkoku. It's no surprise that Lum is considered one of the most beautiful, and greatly drawn characters in anime history. Lum is in her own way unique and beautiful, and she is like a mother-figure to modern-day beautiful super-natural females. The overall art (cities, animals/aliens, characters) is really old-fashioned (reminder: 1980s) but it really added to the livliness of the entire story.
All in all, Urusei Yatsura isn't perfect, and it most definitely isn't the greatest classic out there. But Urusei Yatsura is a trailblazer in anime history, and it remains as a mother-figure show for modern-day romance-comedies, and for those of you that have a lot of time on your hands and want to check out a true classic rom-com anime, then Urusei Yatsura is definitely the one to check out.",Positif
"If I were to recommend only ONE show for someone to watch if they were new to anime. I can't say for sure that this one would top the list, but it'd definitely be one of the candidates to hold that spot.
This show is just one thing:
""good, old-fashioned anime fun""
The show excels at being absolutely random, and absolutely outrageous at some points. It's kinda like the Simpsons but with that fun and exaggerated anime twist added to it. That's why I genuinely enjoyed watching this show, it's just made me laugh at the situations that the characters get themselves into; or what they do to
each other.
The only thing I didn't like about the show is that after you try to marathon thru the show and you watch 10-15 episodes in one sitting.. the show will probably become less enjoyable. I watched all 195 episodes, but it took me well over a year (with on-and-off periods throughout) to complete watching it all.
Take your time with it, you'll enjoy it!",Positif
"Long series can live or die on the strength of their cast, and Urusei Yatsura has one of the best around. Provided you have the patience to sit through the first twenty episodes, and the endurance to remain interested for the last one hundred and seventy five of them. It's going to take a lot of resilience and nobody is going to blame you for giving up before the end. Yet this series is a highly influential classic and the least you could do is indulge in it a little, even if it's only as an introduction before preceding to the second movie spin-off, the
seminal 'Beautiful Dreamer'.
Urusei Yatsura is the story of a lecherous high school student called Ataru Moroboshi and his alien wife, Lum Invader. The partnership is less than mutual though because while Ataru does care for Lum and even finds her attractive, he is unwilling to settle for her alone. He also struggles with commitment, starting to lose interest in Lum as soon as she starts returning his advances. He's a bit of an archetype, clearly the inspiration behind many a leading harem character. But while many of those characters are 'innocent' or 'naive' young men who find themselves wandering or collapsing on top of perverse situations, Ataru actually seeks these out. What this costs in the audience's sympathy is more than made up for in laughs. We can even respect him more than most harem leads simply because he isn't an utterly spineless git.
His spouse, while a weaker character, is an even bigger anime icon. Even anime fans who've never heard of Urusei Yatsura are likely to have seen Lum Invader portrayed or referenced somewhere along the line. If you ever catch a character in a tigerstripe bikini with horns or green hair, it's a nudge to Urusei Yatsura's leading lady. She is sometimes said to be the original tsundere, and although that term has become whittled down almost to a formula at this point, in Lum's day a tsundere personality still came across as human instead of robotic. Unfortunately she retains a number of character flaws common in female anime characters: particularly her excessive doting on Ataru even though he does not treat her with much respect. The premise of the show is dependent on this, but even so all the best episodes are those which deviate from it: either by dealing with an entirely separate matter, or in the rare moments where Ataru's feelings for Lum are central to the plot.
Before Ataru met Lum, he had been dating a girl called Shinobu. In contrast to the docility of Lum, Shinobu is an aggressive girl with an incendiary temper. Earlier episodes focus on Ataru's efforts to continue his relationship with Shinobu, but after some time she finds a new boyfriend: Mendou Shutaro. The eldest son of an exorbitantly rich family, he demands respect at all times even though his behaviour seldom warrants it. Mendou is the strongest member of the cast. Things are never truly 'funny' until his character is introduced, and most of the series humour is derived from his rivalry with Ataru. His vast wealth also provides the opportunity to introduce some ridiculous elements into the show, like his family's private army and castle. It also creates a bit of satire, since for all his pretentions, Mendou is every bit as common as Ataru is. And at least Ataru is aware of his own disgraceful behaviour.
These are the four leading cast members, but there are many more great characters in the show. Mr and Mrs Moroboshi, who Ataru causes little else but grief, are a good example. Ataru's mother in particular has always got a scathing comment to make about her disappointing son. At other times, Ataru's classmates are brought to the forefront. These are young men who are so dedicated to Lum's happiness, that they force Ataru to continue dating her even though they are in love with her themselves. This is to say nothing of the wide variety of alien characters included. Altogether, they make one of the strongest casts in anime and one would have to look at The Simpsons or King of the Hill to find anything that comes close.
But what makes the series difficult to sit through if the cast is so good? There are several reasons. Each episode has a self-contained story and the characters develop very slowly throughout the series. This is perfect for just dipping into every once in a while, as you would if you were watching it on television, but doesn't work so well when you watch a few episodes back to back. It soon starts to become a struggle not to get bored with the lack of progress in the story. This problem is acute in the earlier episodes, which are each split into two separate stories, placing even greater limitations on what any individual story can achieve. However these earlier episodes do have one benefit, which is they allow the creators to introduce most of the very large cast relatively quickly. It is not until around episode twenty, when this split episode structure is abandoned and  longer episode format is used that the series really begins to hit its stride.
When each episode is a self contained story, it's also inevitable that some of them will be better than others. As was alluded to above, the stronger episodes tend to be those which feature the relationship between Ataru and Mendou, or Ataru and Lum as major plot elements. The weakest episodes are  those with a plot involving one-shot characters. Obviously such episodes are always without consequence and are little more than a distraction, or 'filler' if you will.
Urusei Yatsura was made during the first half of the 1980s, with the spin off movies running all the way into the 90s. During that time period, most Japanese animation underwent a great deal of development and became significantly more ""realistic"" in terms of proportions. For example, compare the 1979 series of Mobile Suit Gundam with the 1985 Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam. These two series are roughly contemporary to the start and end of Urusei Yatsura retrospectively and are both from the same series, yet they look radically different. Mobile Suit Gundam almost resembles an American cartoon, while in Zeta there has been a clear effort to make them resemble real people as closely as possible. Such a deviation in style would not seem appropriate in a single series, so improvements within Urusei Yatsura are more modest. Improvements on detail and colouring without tampering with the original, slightly cartoonish art style.
The animation is also simplified. It's common for endless shounen series like this to feature animation that is less than stellar, and while there's nothing groundbreaking here, at least there aren't many scenes where bad animation becomes a problem. When it does stinginess is usually the cause, rather than laziness or ineptitude. Most of the errors do not really stand out, instead a few details are spared when perhaps they shouldn't have been, or a certain sequence will feel like a cell dragged across a background rather than proper 'animation'. It could however be worse, and indeed most would be expecting worse.
Urusei Yatsura may be visually unimpressive, but its soundtrack is spectacular. Everything from the opening and ending themes, to the background music, to the little sound effect when Lum starts flying is fantastic. The main themes are some catchy 80s pop tunes, the best of which is technically not from the TV series. The main theme of UY Movie 2: Beautiful Dreamer is ""Ai wa Boomerang"" and it's a thumping pop tune with a slightly melancholic tone, and I often sing it while showering. The background music and the sound effects all work from a similar palette which complements the series perfectly, capturing the sci-fi wackiness of it all by referencing older science fiction shows like Doctor Who and Star Trek.
Unfortunately there is only so much a good soundtrack can redeem an often enjoyable but overlong and at times slightly tedious anime. Some episodes of Urusei Yatsura are comedy gold, but many of them are just a bit too boring to stomach for long. B nobody said that you must watch all of it, and there's little point in denying yourself something good because of any unhealthy obsession with completing everything you start. Anime is a bit like gambling: you should stop when the fun stops.
And if you're still feel unsure about starting this show, keep in mind that Urusei Yatsura is one of the most influential anime ever made. If you do not bother to at least familiarise yourself with it, your ability to enjoy anime will suffer slightly: obvious references will escape you; old ideas will seem novel. Your understanding of this medium, which is already difficult to comprehend, will always be incomplete. You'll also be missing out on Beautiful Dreamer, one of the better anime films ever made and the 'true' directorial debut of Mamoru Oshii. Last but not least, my darling, you'll also miss out on a series which at its best, is one of the finest comedy anime ever made.",Positif
"Urusei Yatsura is my favorite anime.
•	This isn’t an easy title to achieve with how high my standards for Japanese animation have become, but Urusei Yatsura left a sublimely beautiful impression on me—so much so that I can’t even imagine any other series taking its place. As far as comedy goes, it’s not a bust-your-gut-out-laughing type of series; it’s more dry, tongue-in-cheek humor. My theory on why the BBC English dub of it was so spectacular, while the American dub flopped, was because the British excel at a more dry, witty type of humor than people in the States do.
•	Speaking of ‘obnoxious,’ the title for
Urusei Yatsura is a pun. The word ‘urusei’ (うる星): the character for ‘uru’ (うる) means ‘possible’ and ‘sei’ (星) means ‘good’ or ‘nice’—is a pun on the word ‘urusai’ (うるさい) which can be translated as ‘noisy’ or ‘annoying.’ The title was localized in English as ‘Those Obnoxious Aliens,’ but a more accurate translation would be ‘Possibly Good Aliens’ since the suffix in the word is ‘(uru)sei’—not ‘(uru)sai.’ The title really fits the mood of the series, all of the cast members have a fixation or fatal flaw that ails them in some way or another, which leads to the screen being flooded with a cataclysm of devilishly fun chaos.
•	The protagonist of the story, Ataru Moroboshi, is a diehard skirt-chaser. Despite already having a girlfriend (Shinobu Miyake), Ataru flirts with every girl in town. One day, aliens (the ‘Oni’) wage an intergalactic war on Earth and give them the chance for reconciliation—via competing with their princess, Lum Invader. Of all people, Ataru is randomly selected to compete against her. Ataru plays dirty, by ripping off Lum’s bikini top, and ends up winning. Shinobu had promised that she would marry him if he won against Lum, so Ataru begins cheering about he and Shinobu’s engagement but Lum interprets this as him wanting to marry HER, and accepts the proposal on live television. This turns into Lum’s alien overlord father forcing them together and Shinobu dumping Ataru because she misunderstood what had happened.
•	Initially, Shinobu was supposed to be the deuteragonist but because of Lum’s popularity (due to her iconic, bishōjo design)—Rumiko Takahashi’s editors made her make Lum the main heroine, instead of Shinobu! Learning from her past failure with making her heroine’s rival too popular, Takahashi reincorporated the Shinobu character into Akane Tendō from Ranma ½ and made the Lum character, Shampoo, less likable. Lum became a cultural icon in anime and directly inspired characters such as Lala Satalin Deviluke (To LOVEる) and Yōko (*いぬかみっ!). Adhering strongly to the ‘oni’ theme, each alien is based off of some subset of traditional Eastern lore (Oyuki is a *yuki-onna, Benten refers to *Benzaiten, and Ran is a *hone-onna).
*Inukami!—*Benzaiten is a Japanese Buddhist goddess who originated from the Hindu goddess: Saraswati. *Yuki-onna is a snow woman yōkai and *hone-onna is a yōkai that is the Japanese equivalent of a succubus.
•	Despite it being an older series, even when episodes aren’t the cream of the crop in quality, the series makes up for it tenfold in its writing, excellent voice acting, directing, and interesting atmospheric takes. Especially when it shows a certain, titular hill at night and there’s eerie music playing with a talking scarecrow. Urusei Yatsura is so imaginative, certain episodes actually feel as if they’re taking you to another world—a world far enough from familiarity to seem foreign, and yet realistic enough to appear in our plane of existence. A perfect blend of practicality and uncanny valley, similar to My Neighbor Totoro.
•	There are three episodes in the series, that take the surrealism a step further, and go inside the minds of *Ataru, *his mother (Mother Moroboshi), and *father (Father Moroboshi). During these episodes, the mystery behind Ataru’s dysfunctional family is slowly unraveled and causes the audience to heavily empathize with Ataru, often, even more than Lum. Spoilers ahead; there will be spoilers for the rest of the essay! You have been warned! It is even revealed, in one of the final scenes of Urusei Yatsura 3: Remember My Love, that Ataru loves Lum infinitely more than Lum loves him but he’s too afraid to outwardly show it.
*Episode 78: Mijime! Ai to Sasurai no Haha!? (Pitiful! Mother of Love and Banishment!?—Mother Moroboshi’s Freudian analysis episode), Episode 94: Tabi no Yuki Daruma Jōwa (The Story of a Traveling Snow Dharma—Ataru’s terrifying trip, reminiscent of Dickinson’s A Christmas Carol, showing the emptiness of his own desires), and Episode 177: Hoshi ni Negai wo! Ataru Ikka wa Yokubō Panikku (Wish Upon a Star! Ataru Family is Desire Panic—Father Moroboshi’s fever dream of greed and lust).
•	This series peels layers off of its characters and something small is revealed about each of them, episodically, that gradually adds a pieces to the puzzle of their psyche. Because of how subtle these revelations are and how often they are played off as comedy, I consider Urusei Yatsura to have the best character writing in all of anime. After subtle, dark revelations were shown about certain characters—I was left flabbergasted and thinking about those moments for days.
•	Although episodic, the formula of this series expects you watch it in its entirety if you want clarity on your favorite characters. That’s why, even though many people suggest Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer (as a gateway into the series), I think it’s a bad idea to start anywhere except for the beginning. My introduction to the series was a borrowed DVD of the first film, Only You, and it was difficult to enjoy the movie in the way its intended because you need to get to know that characters from the beginning. It’s like getting to know a friend for a long period of time before you can establish comfortable ‘inside jokes.’
•	Urusei Yatsura started common trends in anime, even in the fetish department. Tentacles have always been fetishized in Japan but I believe that Urusei Yatsura started the trend specifically IN ANIME. *Episode 29 has scantily clad, Lum being felt up by a giant gardenia’s tentacles. This formula would later be replicated in Dream Hunter Rem and other series. Another trope that was popularized by Urusei Yatsura was the little sister (imōto) fetish, starting with the introduction of the character Asuka, in Episode 132, who has been sheltered from society and instantly falls in love with any man that she considers a ‘brother’ because of her misgivings on the definition of the word.
*Episode 29: Kuchinashi Yori Ai wo Komete (From the Gardenia with Love) and Episode 132: Omiai Jigoku! Yoroi Musume wa Bijo? Kaijo (Matchmaking Hell! Is the Armored Daughter a Beauty? Beast?).
Psychological Analyses of the Urusei Yatsura cast:
—Lum Invader: Lum is less complicated than Ataru but still has her own quips that make her a fairly interesting character to follow. Lum is a spoiled princess. She has a stable family that loves each other, an exact foil of how Ataru is with his family, and often acts as if she’s the center of the universe because of it. She’s lazy, reckless, and *will often twist the truth to get out of punishment. Lum has common sense, despite being an alien princess, and is often a *good judge of character. Unfortunately, she often misunderstands Ataru because of how well he can mask his own feelings. Lum is steadfast in her dedication to Ataru but is *not above kissing other men to make him jealous; a flagrant contradiction to her own repulsion with Ataru’s cheating—she also flirtatiously refers to Mendō by his given name (Shutarō) to make Ataru jealous, neglecting Shinobu’s feelings, and using him to get Ataru’s attention. She often makes mistakes, given her disposition as an overly playful and idealistic girl, but always has the best intentions in mind. Even if you despise people with similar flaws to her, it’s impossible to not like Lum. She tries so hard to woo Ataru that it’s hard not to feel for her. Lum’s characterization as an impure girl is even canonical—when the Kotobukiya scale figure of Lum dropped in 2014, there was a note from Rumiko Takahashi on the side of the box that said: ‘Lum meets passionate craftsman Shirahige and is filled with the latest modeling techniques and attractiveness of current figures, it is passionate, and the appearance of a pure Lum is also beautiful.’
*Episode 18: Hina Matsuri! Ran-chan Tōjō (Girls' Day! Introducing Ran-chan—an introduction to Lum’s childhood friend, Ran, who secretly hates her because she stole the affection of her crush, Rei), the ‘good judge of character’ bit comes from her seeing right through the charades of Shutarō and Inaba, and Episode 178: Kuchizuke Takkyūbin! Dārin Hajimete no Yakimochi!! (Kiss Courier! Darling's First Jealousy!—Lum kisses an alien frog, with the knowledge that he is actually an alien boy that she grew up with, and despite Ataru’s objections, still smooches her childhood friend in front of him).
—Ataru Moroboshi: Ataru is the ill-fated protagonist who is a womanizer, has a horrible family life, bad grades, and is considered ugly among his peers. Not only is Ataru born on Friday the 13th, but also *Butsumetsu (仏滅), and his name Ataru (あたる) is spelled with characters that mean ‘to be struck by a falling star.’ Ataru is initially flirtatious towards Lum but immediately is repulsed when he finds out that (due to a misunderstanding) he is being forced to marry her. Ataru is most likely repulsed by Lum because her overbearing attitude reminds him of his mother, and in the aforementioned Episode 78, Mother Moroboshi reveals that she has a Freudian sexual attraction to her son, a compulsion to control his life because he’s the only reason she’s married to her unfaithful husband (who has squandered their savings on gambling and women), and, also, resentment towards Ataru because he’s the only reason that she doesn’t leave Father Moroboshi. It’s messed up! No wonder why Ataru is afraid of commitment! The only woman that he shows an open interest in settling down with is Shinobu—probably because she’s a down-to-Earth girl (no pun intended)—but has to stay with Lum because fear of the Earth being wiped out by the aliens. Throughout the series, Ataru begins to fall deeply in love with Lum but is so addled by his phobia of commitment that he refuses to admit it. This might just be Stockholm syndrome kicking in, because she electrocutes (via ‘electric lynching’) him in every episode, but Ataru’s real feelings for Lum seem genuine. Ataru is the type of person who will do something that’s moral and subvert it by acting amoral, just because he doesn’t want his façade to slip.
*Symbolizes the day Buddha died. Considered the most unlucky day.
—Shutarō Mendō: Basically a good-looking, wealthy version of Ataru. He’s just as much of a womanizer as Ataru is but doesn’t get punished for it because all the girls in class are attracted to him. Shutarō is in the top 2% of the world’s wealth—his family owns the police, the military, and is pretty much the governance of Japan. Mess with the Mendō clan and you’ll be barraged with soldiers and fighter jets! After Shinobu dumps Ataru, she begins dating Shutarō (naïvely creating a princely image of him in her head; in reality, Shutarō only acts the part to keep up appearances) but Shutarō only agrees to date Shinobu because he knows it will hurt Ataru. Shutarō puts on the guise of wanting to date Lum, but throughout the series, it’s implied that he only lusts after Lum because he wants to steal her from his nemesis, Ataru. The resentment he feels for him stems from that fact that he lacks the freedom Ataru has. Ataru is able to openly be a degenerate but Shutarō is forced to act like a gentleman to upkeep the image of his family’s estate. Little does he know that Ataru’s degeneracy is also an involuntary guise that he uses to protect himself from intimacy. Shutarō does not fit in with his family, in *Episode 185—the Mendō family uses all of the main cast as pawns in a death match against each other, whilst Shutarō objects and is completely repulsed by their sociopathic behavior. Shutarō’s younger sister, Ryōko, is a complete psychopath and only sees humans as things to be toyed with—even if it means killing them. When she *almost kills everyone on a gigantic Christmas tree rocket, she shows no remorse for nearly murdering them. It is implied that Ryōko has gone mad from being a *shut-in, whereas, Shutarō leads a fairly normal life because he goes to public school. Ryōko resents her brother for this and seems to get pleasure out of tormenting him; and, weirdly enough, it is implied that Shutarō reciprocates his sister’s feelings—getting overly protective when Ataru tries hit on her. Despite Shutarō being more normal than the rest of the family, he has a weird obsession with octopi and the number eight, as well as an extreme phobia of the dark—no doubt caused by the Mendō family’s sadistic nature.
*Episode 185: Shin Shun Panikku! Mendō Ka Ningen Sugoroku Taikai (New Years Panic! Mendo Family Human Sugoroku Tournament) and Episode 79: Mendō Ke - Samā Kurisumasu (Mendo Family - Summer Christmas). Urusei Yatsura did the cute, shut-in imōto trope before Eromanga Sensei!
—Shinobu Miyake: The most morally righteous and sensible character in the show. She comes from an upper middle class family, is good at piano, intellectually smart, and is kind to a small fox creature (namely ‘Pure Fox’), who has fallen in love with her because of her purity. Like Akane Tendō (Ranma ½), she is freakishly strong but a good person at heart. She dumps Ataru after he agrees to marry Lum (even though he technically is forced to agree to the engagement) and goes for Shutarō, oblivious to the fact that she’s attracted to him because he’s so similar to her childhood friend, Ataru. Since she’s known him so long, she knows that Ataru is a good guy (deep down) but still rages at him for being a jerkass. Unfortunately, after she breaks up with Shutarō, she ends up with another scummy guy (Inaba)—who alters reality to force her to fall in love with him. Poor Shinobu can never get a break. She’s more likable than Lum, in a lot of ways, but because of her comparative lack of screen time, you’re almost forced to sympathize with Lum more.
*Episode 122: Kitsune no Kata Omoi Koisuredo Setsunaku... (The Fox's Hard Feelings of Painful Love..)
—Ryūnosuke Fujinami: The progenitor to Ranma Saotome (Ranma ½), Ryūnosuke is a girl who is forced to live as a boy by her abusive father. She yearns to be a girl, but if she refers to herself as female or wears feminine clothing—her mentally-ill father will beat her up and tell her that a ‘boy shouldn’t wear girls’ clothing.’ This is played off for laughs but as the series goes on, you feel more and more sorry for Ryūnosuke’s disposition. She has been conditioned to be male for so long, that she doesn’t even know the basics of acting like a normal girl. She admires Shinobu because, by studying her from afar, she has deemed her to be the perfect example of femininity. Ryūnosuke also has no idea who her real mother is. Her father has a running gag in the series, where he tells a lengthy tale of what her biological mother was like but ends up mournfully calling out a different woman’s name every time! Ryūnosuke has extreme gender dysphoria, even though she’s technically the gender she wants to be—because her father forces her to bind her chest and wear mens’ clothing.
•	Urusei Yatsura is the only anime series that I consider to be a masterpiece. It has excellent character writing (rife with complexities and human error), great designs, the seiyū fit the characters perfectly, the humor is intelligent, and the directing was revolutionary, at the time, and even now! Urusei Yatsura is a game-changer that is full of magic and amazement for old and young minds alike. Unfortunately, Rumiko Takahashi poured all of her ingenuity into Urusei Yatsura and that originality that makes this series so special—is severely lacking in her later works. I think that creations like Ranma ½ and Inuyasha became too commercialized and Takahashi lost touch with what made her work so great to begin with. It isn’t the hollow marionettes, that mime their predecessors—but—the emotional complexity, cycles of the characters repeatedly spiraling into their own hypocrisy, and their faulty human characteristics that brought them to life! Not Ranma ½’s childish romantic fluff, or Inuyasha’s neglect of characters for grandiose world-building, nor is it Kyōkai no Rinne’s vapid amelioration of character inconsistencies that made her first manga so special. It was attention to detail, the realism, the surrealism, and the basic affection for the characters that were lovingly conveyed through their triumphs and flaws. At this time in my life, I doubt that a TV anime could ever replicate the passion put into Urusei Yatsura. And that is why I and the remnants of its diehard fanbase are so taken with this show!",Positif
"I know this is going to sound like epic hyperbole, but please bear with me in the course of this review. My life has been subjected to a number of happy coincidences, so crazy in their randomness and so profound and wonderful in their effects. One of them was the one-in-a-million chance in which I met my girlfriend (we kinda ""met cute,"" and now we're preparing to live together), and another was a chance meeting during one summer with someone who would go on to become my first full-time employer, a great help in getting into law school, and a treasured personal mentor.
Chancing upon AND
deciding to give Urusei Yatsura - Those Obnoxious Aliens - was just another such astronomical, happy coincidence. Again, I don't mean to make it sound so overly dramatic, but when I found it randomly flipping through AniDb.net, I was strongly tempted to shrug and move on. I had been serially burning through anime and manga series for over a year, and I needed a real diamond in the rough to rekindle my interest in Japanese media.
I don't remember what ultimately pushed me to go ahead and actually watch my first episode, but that first episode was all I needed to get hooked. I loved the satirical, esoteric Japanese humor. I felt like I was watching a Japanese Simpsons, and somehow I feel like I've learned quite a bit about classical Japanese culture despite never having taken a class, and surely more than I've felt I learned from previous series. I also loved the general tone of the series, especially in the first hundred or so episodes (directed by Mamoru Oshii), because it reminded me of American cartoons from the '50s and '60s if they had been willing to be a little more daring with their bawdy and scatalogical humor.
There's a WHOLE ton of stuff I want to say about this series that could span volumes, but I want to make this review relatively brief, so I will simply say that if you want a more in-depth breaking down of my thoughts on UY, please check out my blog, which has a link to my OTHER blog, where I've written a full review. But why, if I've already written that, would I write a review here? Well, there were a couple of thoughts I left out while writing that one, because I was only about 1/6th of the way through the series at the time. Now I'm done with the TV series proper and working on the OVAs and the last couple movies, and I have a few new observations I want to share now that I've seen all 195 episodes.
Man, 195 episodes. The only show I've ever watched that was even AS long was Friends, and no cartoon series I've watched ever came close! So suffice it to say that my life for an entire month has consisted of Ataru, Lum, Shinobu, Mendou, and the rest of the wacky denizens of Tomobiki. Having finished the series, now more than ever I can say that the characters actually are the strongest factor the show has going for it, despite what many may say about the lack of character development. For a series that totally screwed around with the chronology of the original manga, they manage to flesh out and grow the characters to a surprising degree, all while maintaining at least a loose semblance of chronological progression. And although I hated troublemakers like Lum's cousin Ten or her rival Ran - at first - I was amazed to find that by the end, they had all grown on me. As much as I groaned at how creepy and cruel Megane and Lum's Stormtroopers were in the beginning, I now consider them some of my favorite characters in the entire series. They are hilarious, and UY would not be the same without them, just as much as can be said for its two leads.
I mentioned in my blog review that one of UY's strong selling points with me was the art style. It's not always consistent (although it does get consistently better over the years), but I found it refreshing, and now that I'm done I can say this with even more certainty. I love shows like Clannad, Haruhi Suzumiya, and Shining Tears x Wind, but I feel like anime art styles have become increasingly homogenous since the '90s. UY's art style grabbed me immediately because it reminded me of the original Dragon Ball, a very nostalgic series for me and among my all-time favorites. And I was not disappointed; from the silly to the epic, the animators proved themselves very versatile, but also very fresh (probably why they burned out towards the end though). If you need a break from modern anime (and don't get me wrong, 99% of my favorite anime was from the last decade or so), I urge you to try an episode or two.
Also fascinating, now that I've seen the entirety of the main series, is I've realized what a seminal work this is. I know they didn't pull things out of thin air and I'm sure even the original source material was building off of old tropes, but since finishing the main body of the series, I took a break from UY to sample a couple of more recent shows. I nearly died of surprise and amusement as I realized just how many modern anime tropes stemmed from characters, plots, and situations implemented in UY. The ridiculously wealthy family with its own private army and a property containing half of Japan? The Mendou clan. (Semi-)ecchi harem comedy? Willful harem seeker Ataru and every attractive female in the known universe. Magical girlfriend? Why, Lum of course. Moe and tsundere traits in a female lead? Lum again. Bishounen played for laughs? Mendou Shutaro and Ataru both have their moments. It's also very cool to see what I imagine are some older tropes that fell out of fashion after the period during which this series had its run. It's kinda like watching an old time movie, where you can get a sense for an entirely different set of cultural circumstances because the stuff they're making fun of is hardly mentioned in contemporary series.
Don't get me wrong; this series is not perfect, and not always totally enjoyable. One thing I got tired of pretty early on was the music. Not that the music was bad or anything, and actually there was quite a bit of variety, but that variety is almost for naught considering how many episodes they stretch them out for. Maybe that indicates it's more a symptom of the series being extremely long than anything to do with the music, but take it as you will. There are also definitely points (and unfortunately sometimes streaks) at which the episodes do drag on, because the humor doesn't work or it feels incongruent, or hey, maybe you're tired of Ataru giving Lum sh*t or Lum putting up with his sh*t. Luckily these are usually followed by marathons of episodes that are leagues better, and on the whole I would say UY's enjoyment factor and overall worth is greater than the sum of its parts. It's an experience I will never forget, and to which I hope to return again and again.
Thank you for reading my review. Please, please watch this series. As another reviewer said, it's a crying shame that otherwise open-minded anime lovers and general lovers of entertainment will pass on this one just because it's older. The modern stuff is great and is sure to get better with time, but classics like these deserve to be remembered and treasured, because 'classic' is a title well-deserved for Urusei Yatsura. Happy (girl) hunting!",Positif
"Lum was technically one of the first anime characters I ever saw. Back when I was hardly into anime, I saw some Dragon Ball fan animation that had Lum as a cameo. I was intrigued, so I looked up who it was. Despite this, I didn't show any interest in watching her show until years later. I watched the first twelve episodes, and although I was addicted, I was turned off by how adult it got. I stopped watching it for a long time, but there were times when I missed it. Surely enough, I couldn't stay away from it, so I started it again
from the thirteenth episode, and watched the whole series over the course of six months, including the movies and OVAs.
So many things about this anime made it memorable and enjoyable. The episodes had different feels from each other, but each one had something to like about it. Some of the episodes are crazy, nonsensical shenanigans, and others are serious with touching drama or romance. This is a universe where virtually anything can happen, so there's no limit to the stories they could tell. It could be fooling with alien technology, or meeting mythical creatures such as ghosts or vampires. Not only are the situations unpredictable, but the way the characters interact with the situations is too, so there are lots of surprises. And the characters being as good as they are makes the situations even more enjoyable.
The side characters all have different roles in the story, as well as different relationships with Ataru and Lum. Lum is generally favored by them, whereas Ataru is generally disfavored. This leads to many different character interactions that are always entertaining. The side characters all have their own situations going on, that make you care about them. This means you can be invested in an episode regardless of who's in the forefront.
Ataru, the true protagonist of the show, is one of the most entertaining ones I've seen. His main interest is girls, but his persistence and determination make him more memorable than all the other pervert and semi-pervert protagonists. He's constantly hitting on girls and being punished for it, but he never ceases to go after them. He'll often use trickery to get away from Lum, and shrug off any hits from girls who reject him. He's also not afraid to tell Lum off.
Lum seems like she'd be a Mary Sue, being a beautiful superpowered alien who all the boys love. However, her flaws are very clearly there, and become more apparent over time. She has a short temper, she's sometimes loopy or clueless, and she can be just as vulnerable as any of the other characters. Her strongest trait is easily her attraction to Ataru. It never goes away, regardless of what he does, or what happens. Her main wish is for Ataru to love her and only her, and to be with him forever. She'll go to great lengths to do it, never giving up hope. She cares about Ataru very much, only attacking him when he angers her.
The relationship between these two is the most compelling thing about this anime. We know how Lum feels about Ataru, but Ataru's feelings are never 100% clear. Based on the situation, he either likes or hates her. The interactions between these two are something to look forward to. They might get angry at each other, or they might have a meaningful romantic moment. Their relationship could make or break at any moment, but never permanently.
There's an overall sense of tension between many of the characters that leads to a lot of slapstick. This slapstick gets repetitive, especially in the second half of the show. Yet, the episode plots differ from each other greatly, so the show overall isn't repetitive.
Background music is a surprisingly important part of the anime. There are all kinds of different tracks it uses. Some of the tracks even have a fittingly extraterrestrial theme to them. There is background music playing a lot of the time, and it is always appropriate to the situation. There is casual music, epic music, romantic music, silly music, suspenseful music, and so on.
If I were to assign this anime to genres, I'd say slice of life, sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, and romance, which is ordered from most to least prevalent. It's harder to narrow it down, since the anime does all kinds of things. And given how long it is, it certainly can afford doing what it wants.
I can just imagine all the Japanese kids in the 80's watching new episodes of this anime every week, and it being their favorite thing. It gives you a lot in each episode, and even references other popular properties at the time, whether they be Japanese or American. There are multiple story arcs involving different characters, and also quick callbacks to previous episodes. It always tries its best, and it strives to be something you'll never forget. So much love was put into the anime from the beginning, that made it everything that it is.",Positif
"This is not a good fantasy anime. I don't think it's a good romance anime as well, since the plot runs pretty much on rails, which is made worse by the fact that the rails are those of a tropeish romance. But maybe you like trope-ridden romance, so let me focus on the fantasy aspects.
Fantasy has certain expectations, like having a setting that is fantastic without endangering the suspension of disbelief. For an instance, if the capital has access to water despite the eternal drought, why does the emperor needs a rainmaker? Why would the author make a city with no rain if that has
no effect on the city or on the people? It's like the author thought it would be nice thematically, but never gave any thinking to the possible consequences (also, there is no way that extremely green palace exists in a place without rain and let's not talk about the amount of crops needed to feed a conquering army.). I'll not mention the royal protocol problems, because anime enjoys the hell out of not adhering to protocols (mainly because their lovely princes would have to sentence people to death, since you have to remember people the royals are untouchable), but I'll have to say there is a visible lack of nobility. Those guys that wanted to oust the king/emperor, did they actually have a plan or they intended to drown the world in a succession war? I'd call it a plot hole, but there isn't much plot to speak of, since the story is mostly about the romance and any other part of the plot just goes away. I mean, the opposing nobles just gave up on their conspiracy after a minor setback.
Which leads me to the characters, which are generally stereotyped and mostly devoid of motivations, so that they feel like plot-puppets. Even the main characters just act the way plot expects them to, without consideration or planning. Livius is technically a tyrant, but he's a cute little tyrant that everyone likes, so that's ok, even if he tortures people or threatens to destroy your country for any reason. The dark part doesn't matter, because it's there just as window dressing: he's a dark prince, that's all. And Nike is the innocent/joyful princess that never heard of diplomacy, even though she was raised/groomed by the queen mother, possibly to succeed her, and should be at least aware of politics. But why would she,  if it's cuter and more tropeish to be an innocent flower, right? All the enforced stereotypes make for a disappointing story, is what I'm saying.
And don't get me started on Rain All The Time country and it's pointless royalty.
In general, bad fantasy, author Did Not Do Research.
As for the rest, well, there is nothing incredible about the sound, animation or technical aspects. The character designs look a bit dated (the series is few years old) and the clothes make absolutely no sense, unless you'd care to explain why do the people from eternal summer country choose to cover head to toe (even their religion is sun-centered. You'd expect hiding from the sun to be anathema to that).
Overall I do not recommend to anyone but the most dedicated shoujo fans.",Negatif
"This initial episode sets a nice mood, however the rest of the story fails to really live up to it.  Maybe that's because it was a bit too rushed.
The idea of rain summoning through music is an interesting one, and does add some points of interest.  The sound track for these bits was really enjoyable and they did make some emotional connections.
However in the end, I found the characters fairly flat and their motivations and backstories felt rushed and lacking.  I feel like it had a good bit of potential, but the story ends up losing its way somewhere.
For example, I felt we needed to see more of the character's initial misunderstandings for their relationship to really feel like it had some solid tension.  Also the young king's backstory is emotional, but I felt like it lacked a good bit of depth.  There was some limited attempt to add backstory and detail, but limited number of episodes may have prevented this, or it may have saved us from a bunch of random filler, we'll never know.
You may find this more enjoyable than I did.  I stuck around for all the episodes because I did like the characters to some degree, and I figured I'd stick it out to see the end given the limited episode count.",Negatif
"This is actually my second time watching Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii. My first, I was  buzzed because I had just caught up with the manga. Rewatching now, I see the animation is pathetic. Mostly, the characters just stand there as their mouths move. Their bodies do not shift; the scenery does not change; there is absolutely no motion. I immediately stopped when 10-15 minutes into episode 2, some random guards had more motion that the MCs. I usually like animations of mangas with music, because I can actually hear the songs, but the manga was much more lively than the anime. The characters may
as well be cardboard cutouts.",Negatif
"Really hoped that this would be another anime which I would enjoy and have fun watching. However, that is not the case. Before you go any further reading this review, it is important that I tell you, I dropped this anime after watching the third episode. Why? The story of this anime did not seem interesting and was not able to capture my attention at all through the first 3 episodes. The romance was lacking and there was not exciting events or subplots to make up for it. If you are a fan of constant talking with no real meaning to the conversations then this
anime is probably for you. Watching this felt like a waste of time to me. I basically forced myself to finish watching at least 3 episodes to see if story would get more interesting, with no luck. It is possible that the story develops later on (similar to steins;gate where the story towards the end of the anime is so much better then the beginning), but seeing that it is a 12 episode anime, the best that could happen is that it gets interesting for the 3 last episodes.
The art and music included in this anime was fairly good, so nothing to complain about that.
Overall, if you are a person who enjoys hardcore romance or want excitment  when you watch animes, this isn't the one for you.",Negatif
"I'll admit, the anime did almost no justice for Livius & Nike's relationship as they are portrayed in the manga. I've read most of the manga and watched the whole anime. I do agree with reviews saying the anime adaptation was mediocre, but I'd like to review the manga instead.
Still World is Beautiful has to be one of my favourite shoujo mangas. The author spares no detail with the art, you can really get blown away into their fantasy world. While Nike is pretty in the anime, her manga self has a whole different set of charm & beauty. Same with Livius, his character is
drawn in a way where you can really see he's lost & hurt, yet still has his distinctive charm. Now, I can't really say that I wished the animation looked exactly like the manga, as that would be hard, but in order to understand what I mean, you should pick up the manga.
I really enjoy the story. The anime only scratches the tip of the iceberg with their relationship & story. I felt the anime only covered the romance & wit, rushing their relationship. The story, while in some parts drags, is light & fun, different from the anime's portrayal(first 18 chapters).
I also wanted to address their age gap: many people think it's weird(rightly so), 12(this is cannon in the manga) & 16(unspecified) is quite a jump. However, I feel like it should also be more well known that large age gaps weren't exactly uncommon in the times it takes place.
The second would be Nike's name and how it's pronounced. I found it odd at first, I thought it would be like ""Nye-kee""(like the shoe brand), but after studying the Japanese language, I realized its spelt ニケ（にけ）, which is pronounced as ""nee-keh"".
While many people have come to watch the anime first(vice versa for me), please don't let it discourage you from reading the author's original works.",Negatif
"I was looking for an anime to watch... saw this title, it was good rating, lots of positive reviews, praises everywhere, why not try it out?
Mistake.
I'm kinda confused why so many people like it when I can't even finished because it's just... so... bad. I watched 3 episodes and had enough. No, not gonna continue or like it. I know how I feel. Tbh, from every anime I have watched so far, this may be the worst one.
Imagine reading a very bad fanfiction. The most stereotypical, predictable one. With stupid powers, stupid plot, with grammar errors, poorly formatted, dots missing, your main character is
a Mary Sue and everyone hates her or loves her, she helps someone but it feels like I've seen something like this a million times even though I didn't. ...And this is how this feels. I don't know what else to say. I watched a few episodes to see if it's interesting but I was just left with distaste. This anime just sounds like bad fanfiction and I'm not here for it.
Don't like the plot or the characters or even the art style.",Negatif
"Nichijou means ""Everyday Normal (Life)"", and this anime is nothing close to that.
Are drugs illegal in your country? Well, most likely they are. But assume that you had access to all of them, then you bought one of each kind, and then you mixed them all in one big pot, and then you drunk a spoon of that drug-soup. The final effect? Something close to Nichijou.
You'll be living with a state of mind, where you imagine you're living in reality and experiencing all kinds of daily life, but actually you're lying on the floor and staring at the ceiling, yet you don't realize it. That's
how it feels to watch Nichijou. For someone sane like me this anime is nonsense from beginning to end, but if you're drugged enough you'll call it slice-of-life or something like that.
Examples? Too many too mention - pretty much everything. Just watch one episode, and you'll understand.
Genre - Comedy. Where?
Some people claim it's funny. Are talking cats funny? Is it fun to watch a retarded kid talk sloooooowly. Is it fun to see a clumsy girl forgot her homework? Or is it funny to see someone suddenly take out a bazooka from out-of-nowhere and shoot at their friends? If you find those things funny, then you really need to check out 9gag, and if you still continue finding Nichijou funny, check yourself with a local psychiatrist. More than likely they'll successfully diagnose you with some disorder.
Relaxing? More like headache-inducing!
The so-called-humor is so over-the-limit that it's not funny. It's either pitiful to watch or disgusting or simply boring. Technically, it gives you a headache if you watch it for long enough. In the whole period of 26 episodes I haven't laughed even once, but after 26 episodes I'm close to puking.
Creative?
Yes, I haven't seen anything as creative as this since 2girls1cup! The abnormality is over-the-top and I have to agree, I wouldn't be able to come up with so much b.s. no matter how long I would spend thinking.
Characters:
If you find a group of druggies in the back-alley somewhere, then I bet you it's gonna be exactly the same atmosphere. The characters of Nichijou are really not much different from druggies. Their personalities are unrealistic, and don't occur in real life unless you make someone take a bunch of drugs.
Art:
Possibly the only thing acceptable about this anime.
Regarding Recommendations:
Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou - this one stays in the realm of reality, while Nichijou flies to the planet of druggies.
Azumanga Daioh - very similar, but Azumanga had better characters.
Lucky Star - this was at least funny, Nichijou lacks any humor what-so-ever.
School Rumble - similarly unrealistic, but School Rumble was a bit more funny.
Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei - this is a parody of all kinds of characters, nothing in common with Nichijou.
Nisemonogatari - someone took too many drugs and added this completely unrelated series as a recommendation.
Arakawa Under the Bridge - this is a story from the land of dreams, not the land of drugs! Don't mix up the two!
Gintama - how can you compare a masterpiece like Gintama to a crap like Nichijou?
I'll finish here, in the end I was only pissed off about seeing Gintama as a recommendation...
Final Question:
Why did I rate it as 1/10?
Because my limited brain is slowly running out of space for watching crap, and every 100 anime or so my scoring gets harsher and harsher, and I was going to score this as 2/10, but then I'm a cat lover, and I don't have enough fingers to count all the scenes that involve physical abuse of a poor Sakamoto (the cat).
Some people find animal abuse funny, especially when they're on drugs, so I'm not surprised that the ""humor"" of this anime revolves around this kind of ""fun"".
By the way, previous sentence is also a very good one-sentence summary of the whole anime.",Negatif
"I went and started this anime with high expectations, i even heard this was the funniest anime ever, but after i watched like 3 episodes i was so bored from this shit and didn't laugh once. This animes story is just 3 best friends and a 3 year old scientist that made a robot even though she seems stupid af. The story it self is not enjoyable at all and is very boring. The ,,comedy'' is pretty bad, anyone that can read and hear will obviously see how unfunny this is at first sight. I don't know at all why this anime has a good
score, obviously people have their own tastes in anime but damn this is hella boring. If you are looking for a funny anime I beg you don't watch this please, if you are looking for a good story also don't watch this. I can't think of a single reason to recommend this to anyone, after you watch this you will probably feel like quiting anime for a while. Very boring anime, do not recommend!",Negatif
"I came here with high hopes as I had watched quiet alot of people talk about this anime(on YouTube etc).So I decided to sit back and enjoy a good,funny anime and pass my time(quarantined at my house due to coronavirus).But oh boy, what a disappointment this anime was!
Good parts:-
Animation is fluid and sharp and the mood looks lively. Anyone who has watched the anime can easily tell how much effort is put on details of the art work.
Bad parts:-
The comedy part hit me hard. To be completely honest, some of the jokes were good and funny , but the bad ones just spoiled the mood
completely.
Weird stuff keeps on happening every damn moment. The weird still shots of buildings just annoy the hell out of me. At first I was okay with the weird type of comedy but I got bored and annoyed and left the anime at the 7th episode.  I hope anyone who is reading this tries to reconsider their decision of wasting their precious time on this crappy show. Maybe some people (actually alot after seeing the rating, liked the anime. This means that maybe it just wasn't my taste. So if you like random jokes with funny faces, this might become your favourite anime)
OR
Instead I'll recommend you to watch some anime that I loved and cherished (If you haven't watched them already)
1. Assassination classroom
2. Mob psycho 100
3. Saiki k
4.toradora
And many more(because in my opinion, any anime is better than nichijou",Negatif
"Maybe there is more than one series called Nichijou as going into this seeing how much it is raved and fawned over I expected a lot more, and instead I dropped it after barely 6 episodes and really didn't like it at all.
I completely agree with Japan on this one and think the West have got it wrong I just found this completely unfunny and felt it really tried too hard in that regarded and for me it completely failed in that respect.
Obviously everyone has a different sense of humor, so that is probably where the difference in opinions lies but still seeing people going
on about a second series and how great it was, seriously get over it this series went over really badly in Japan...so your never getting your second series and honestly the news of a dub for this series (which is now fairly old) boggles my mind, guess they think there is some kind of audience out there for it.",Negatif
"Nichijou is like that kid in the class that tries to be the class clown by saying random, odd stuff, in the off chance that it gets a laugh out of you. You appreciate his effort, but ultimately, he just isn't funny, and can be downright annoying. Nichijou is a show I walked in with very high expectations for. Kyoto Animation is one of my favorite studios of all time, and manages to create beautiful, unique, and entertaining shows. Everybody I've talked to who has seen this series has raved about how it's a masterpiece, so I wanted to try it out. Now, before I
say anything bad, I want to start off with the good parts. The animation is spectacular. It's unique, and you can tell there was a lot of work put into it. I also loved the voice actors and the OP and EDs. They were all enjoyable and were the main reason I kept watching the show intp the first place. Unfortunately, this is where my praise ends. Nichijou, as you may know, is a comedy show. As such, you expect it to be funny. Well, 90% of the time, the show isn't funny. Most of the time the ""jokes"" seen like inside jokes that you're not in on. Hell, half the time, the jokes don't even have a punchline. Most of the show's so called ""comedy"" is something strange happening for a drawn out period of time, and then another character reacts to the strange event. Now I don't want to make it sound like I don't like stupid humor, because I do. I love comedy acts like Monty Python and TV shows that have over the top situations. But most of the show just feels like it was written by a middle schooler. It just seems like all the show does is try to throw as many things on the screen as possible. Nothing in the show is coherent, either. It's kind of like a sketch show, but instead of sketches, random objects and events happen, without any rhyme or reason. I could forgive that if there was a comedic payoff, but there rarely is one. While Nichijou is undeniably a fun, well animated show, it is equally confusing, unfunny, and just seems to try too hard to be funny.",Negatif
"*SPOILER FREE*
Aight, it's time for me to review this. It seems I am a part of the minority that despises this show completely, and I will try to explain why. ALL OF THIS IS MY OPINION. Please don't insult me just for having a different opinion than you, because you'll just prove how childish and braindead you are. Let's do this.
Story: 3/10
Yeah, no. This anime has little to none story, introducing us to this group of first 3, then 4 students. The story follows this group just... messing around... i guess. Since it's a slice of life, you can't just expect it to have the
most outstanding and mindblowing plot out there, but PLEASE give us something at least. Its really hard to like this show if you have no idea if the stuff that's happening is important to the plot or not, and if it will make at least something change in the story.
Art: 9/10
Ok, this is where Nichijou shines. As of expected from Kyoto Animation, the artstyle and animation are absolutely stunning. I personally love and admire this peculiar and original look that Nichijou has, and let me tell you it's hard to find an anime out there as attractive as this one.
Sound: 9/10
One of the only good things this show actually has, the OST. I personally love both of the openings; I think they are a complete blast to listen to, just like the ending (the first one, the second one is absolute trash). So, yeah; these songs are absolutely amazing and I personally believe they ended up being iconic in the anime community.
Character: 5/10
Really mediocre. I mean, yeah, there is your average tsundere, shy girl, quiet girl, weird girl, popular girl, etc, but that's exactly why these characters are so fucking boring. They lack personality! All of them are absolutely predictable and none out of ALL the characters in the whole anime change during the ""story"". However, them being predictable doesn't mean they can't be likeable.
Enjoyment: -10/10
And here is the one and only reason I ABSOLUTELY HATE this piece of shit. This can be a consequence of me not having the ""style"" of humor the anime does have, but either way it doesn't matter. It got old really quickly. Past episode 6 the anime starts to repeat the same weird and non-sense jokes that instead of making me laugh made me question if my life was worth living. This is not a joke.
I made a promise some months ago that consisted of if I started an anime, I HAD to finish it, and oh boy do I regret it. Like I previously said, Past episode 6 or so Nichijou became a boring, repetitive and predictable piece of shit that made me want to finish it as quick as possible. I got absolutely pleased as soon as one episode finished, and I can't explain how relieved I was when I finished the whole anime. I NO JOKE suffered during my binge watch, and absolutely regret wasting some moments of my life watching this anime. Nichijou, please take your shitty jokes and go fuck yourself.
Overall: 3/10
As a conclusion, I can say that this anime by itself is the reason why I hate the comedy genre. Please, PLEASE, avoid this suffering.",Negatif
"Absolute garbage.
first time around it was an ok anime, after watching azumanga daioh which it absolutely copied it reveals itself as a trashy clone, with over the top animation making up for the unfunny unrelatable exagerated characters and nonsensical situations, which would be justifiable if they made you laugh at least once, but they never do. All of the jokes are very hit or miss, mostly miss, they tried quirkyness to make up for a lack of humor which luckily didnt fly too well in japan, only in the west. don't watch this poop show, watch azumanga daioh or its much funnier and zanier male
counterpart danshi kokousei no nichijou",Negatif
"My friends had hounded me for a while to give Nichijou a watch, but from the clips I had been shown on YouTube it just never seemed like my kind of humor.
So I sat through all 26 episodes and the OVA.
The animation team took an opportunity here when given the source material to go absolutely nuts to create over the top, intense, fluid animation sequences whenever that chance arises. There are a lot of sequences and shots to be impressed with, and I feel it's worth watching for those alone.
What I appreciated about Nichijou and the story it doesn't tell is that it doesn't go
through your standard slice of life let's go to osaka/kyoto/komiket/the beach/hotsprings/culture festival scenarios. The world it takes place in is very self contained and that which normal high school girls like the protagonists would be familiar with.
There's far more of a focus on romance subplots than I initially thought this would have. Characters are pretty bland, but their quirks and the way they interact more or less entertained me.
Nichijou is the epitome of taking things as far as they can possibly go.
As an anime I feel Nichijou isn't bad. You can tell the work that was put into it was genuine and you can appreciate that.
As a comedy I feel Nichijou fails.
I may have cracked a smile twice through the entirety of Nichijou, and as a series I had heard nothing but praise for the comedy of I just don't get that appeal.
When the writers commit to a joke you're going to sit through several minutes of back and forth between characters that is supposed to be fun absurdist humor but the longer it drags on, the more it wears on you and starts to get annoying.
There are a lot of sequences like this, and as the series is chopped up into a bunch of self contained shorts and side stories, it makes me feel as if it would have probably been better suited to sit as 15 minute or less shorts in between other shows if it were aired on television.
Too much of Nichijou gets on your nerves fast and though I didn't find it funny, I can say that it at least entertained me throughout the runtime.",Negatif
"As someone who has only seen 45 or so episodes, take this with a grain of 'salt'.
The art is quite nice, it's easy on the eyes, and everything is well defined. Nendou, and how Saiki reacts to him is by far the funniest part of Saiki K. Now we've got those two good things out of the way, le's talk about the rest.
Nearly every episode feels like you've gained nothing from it, characters don't develop, and they don't lead to any sort of overall arc. So it's basically all filler, does that mean it should automatically be bad just because it doesn't lead to anything?
Hell no. The problem is that Saiki Kusuo just isn't funny enough to be only filler. This anime feels like Mob Pyscho, just, if you take away all the story, character development, and actual funny characters, you end up with Saiki K (even the humour isn't at Mob Pyscho's level tbh). It's not an awful anime, it's just pointless to watch unless you find the humour really funny, in which case, I did not.",Negatif
"Going to keep this review spoiler free.
To make a clever analogy, Sword Art Online is similar to an apple that looks fresh on the outside but is all rotten inside. If you have ever heard of the ""Rotten Apple"" theory which states that one rotten apple can ruin an entire barrel, that is what I am affraid of.
Anime series similar to Sword Art Online will spread like mold in an old house, resulting in lowering the current set standards for a ""good"" show.
Intro:
Unfortunately the very premise of the show makes it hard to take seriously. A new innovative game ""Ordinal Scale"" is created and
people are crazy about it until shit hits the fan and Kirito must save the day.
Story: 3/10
The story revolves around Asuna and Kirito's group of friends battling Augma as well as Asuna's and Kirito's romantic relationship. The story is more of a way to connect and insert action scenes rather than progressing with the characters.
To compare SAO:Ordinal Scale's plot with the previous series I would say that Ordinal Scale is better but as the saying goes, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
With that being said, the story is still boring, predictable and borderline ridiculous containing numerous plot holes, plot armor and having a simplistic idea that is poorly executed. Ordinal Scale is a failed mix of comedy, drama and romance but it does have great action scenes that keep attracting viewers.
The story brings nothing new to the table, it is mostly the same old repetitive SAO plot but a bit diffrent and a bit more enjoyable with the only redeeming factor being its pace. Even though the story itself is nothing special, the pacing is pretty good to be honest.
Characters: 2/10
The characters are poor, one-dimensional, cliched, generic and utterly annoying, there is not much to say that can redeem them.
Ordinal Scale features lots of survivors from SAO and I liked seeing them again, just a bit of nostalgia.
Kirito is the same overpowered guy that can defeat anything and anyone if he gets serious. All the girls still fall for him even though he has no charisma or an intriguing personality nor is he particularly intelligent.
In Kirito's defense, I suppose being a hero in a life-or-death game can make most people grow to respect him and maybe ""love"" him.
Asuna is the same as always, a generic damsel in distress that is constantly seeking attention and constantly irritating me. Asuna does have some good moments thorughout the show but that is not nealry enough to redeem her character.
Shino Asada, a generic character from the ALO/GGO series. I liked the fact that she respected Kirito and Auna as a couple even though she had feelings for Kirito therefore not creating further drama.
The only character I liked was Eiji, a badass player who is top ranked and has a cool air about him, won't go into details due to possible spoilers.
The villains are cliched, generic and imbecilic. We have seen these type of villains many, many times before in the provious seasons of Sword Art Online or other low tier anime series.
Animation: 10/10
The overall art and animation is great, fluid with nice design and colors, just what you would expect from a 2017 anime production.
The fight scenes are very well coreographed, fluid and engaging.
The animation does have some glitches but I am compelled to overlook them.
Sound: 7/10
I personally did not like the OST, they used some old SAO music and some new and not very good songs.
The overall sound is pretty good but nothing memorable or to brag about.
Enjoyment: 2/10
After finishing Sword Art Online Ordinal Scale I was left with a ""meh"" feeling and a bad taste in my mouth. Having Kirito wear his old ""black swordsman"" uniform was a sore sight.
There are some good battles and nice scenes but they are not nearly enough to make this a good watching experience.
Overall: 4.3/10
Unfortunately Sword Art Online continues being the malignant  tumor slowly eating away at the good anime production.
The poor plot and generic characters can not be overlooked even though the animation and sound were very good. If you are the typical SAO fan you will love this movie but if you did not like the SAO series you will not like this.
If you are ready to waste 2 hours of your life, I recommend giving this a try since it is so popular.",Negatif
"It's no secret by now that the SAO anime series was basically lackluster at best, combining lazy writing with shallow characters and only getting so much attention because of its brilliant character designs and astronomical production values. Ordinal Scale, though, was surprisingly good. Why?
Because for the first time, SAO became action-centric, rather than plot- or character-centric.
The TV anime focused heavily on its characters. The climax of the Aincrad arc was not Kirito beating the game (spoilers, I guess), but his last scene with Asuna. The Fairy Dance arc focused on its plot, and the Phantom Bullet and Mother's Rosario arcs were basically character studies. Since
these things were written poorly, these arcs were poor as a result.
By the time Alicization came around, Kawahara learned how to write a good plot, and SAO Progressive marked his transition into writing good characters. It's an absolute joy to read about Kirito and Eugeo's exploits in Underworld, compared to the tedium of his harem in Aincrad.
By comparison, Ordinal Scale's plot is extremely simple and straightforward, largely serving as an excuse to serve up action scenes. It centers around a consumer-grade AR device called the Augma, presumably a precursor to Accel World's Neurolinkers (in more ways than one, as is eventually revealed). The conflict in the plot comes from the titular Ordinal Scale, an ARMMO for it. Think ""Pokemon Go meets Aincrad,"" and you're in the right ballpark. Trouble befalls SAO survivors who die in Ordinal Scale, and it's up to Kirito to figure out what's happening and put a stop to it.
The villains are simple, cliche, and boring - you've seen them a million times before. Likewise, the new poster girl, Yuna, joins Yui, Eugeo, and Kizmel in Kawahara's growing list of ""might as well just be human"" AIs. The plot unfolds at a satisfying pace, utilizing a Mother's Rosario-esque structure. The story is completely self-contained. Basically, this is just another original anime movie for a popular anime. So why am I not giving this a five?
Because A-1 Pictures brought their A game on this one.
The action scenes are GORGEOUS. They're beautifully choreographed, making them easy to follow while simultaneously being fast and exciting. Even the final one, which was so fast-paced it'd put Sonic to shame, was an avalanche of awesomeness that I could enjoy without being confused. Captain America Civil War could've learned a thing or two from this movie.
Additionally, all the action scenes were backed by a frankly kickass soundtrack, noticeably getting me more excited than I would be without them. Say what you will about SAO, but you can't deny that it's always had amazing sound direction, and it really shows in this movie.
Don't get me wrong, though. There are plot holes. A LOT of them. How are these places in Tokyo empty enough for a bunch of LARPers to do their thing every night? Lemme tell you, I ain't ever seen the UDX plaza that empty, no matter how late it gets. How is the Augma not constantly making the news when people inevitably become spontaneously idiotic? Remember Pokemon Go? The Augma is supposedly even more prolific, and since it's a product, it's presumably here to stay. How are these make-believe battles actually making people recoil, making them encounter physical resistance to their movements (i.e. when they block an attack), sending them flying, and all these other things? How is Kirito - weak as he is in these battles - able to do even what he DOES accomplish? He is canonically a frail, weak, and slightly effeminate-looking nerd. In any other SAO production, I would not be able to forgive so many plot holes, which reek of the Kawahara who brought us the content of the TV anime. However, I can make an exception for Ordinal Scale.
The movie does not take itself seriously.
One problem with the TV anime is that it overblew the drama, making every single plot point feel like the end of the world. Ordinal Scale doesn't do that. It doesn't linger for longer than it should on any plot event, instead prioritizing constant movement to get to the next action scene. At one point, it even throws all logic and common sense right out the window, since it'd rather be awesome than have a coherent plot. The TV anime wanted you to take its stories and characters seriously, and that didn't work, since the writing was usually bad. By contrast, Ordinal Scale's writing is generally unremarkable (besides the litany of plot holes that perforate it like Swiss cheese), but it doesn't care. Rather than boast and brag and say, ""Look at how great my story is,"" it instead directs your attention to the flashy and exciting fights. It just wants you to have a good time. Don't get me wrong - the fights were the best part of the TV anime too, but the difference is that Ordinal Scale WANTS you to focus on them. It succeeds at what it goes for, whereas the TV anime failed at what it was going for.
That said, there was no reason why there needed to be so many unexplained plot holes - even a comment in passing would have sufficed - so my final rating for Sword Art Online Movie: Ordinal Scale is a seven out of ten.
For all its flaws, it's hard to hate this movie, even for someone who's usually unimpressed by the SAO series. Existing fans will love it, and even haters might find something to like, too.
Also, what was up with that post-credits scene? Unless it spoiled the mastermind of the Alicization arc (which I haven't finished) or the Moon Cradle arc (which I haven't even started), then are we getting more anime-original content?",Negatif
"Nearing the end of the Summer of 2014, SAO’s Gun Gale Online Arc finally draws to a close. Dumbfounded and genuinely surprised at the story arc’s terrible writing, characters and overall aesthetic, I sat back and assessed Sword Art Online up to that point in time, and concluded there and then, that, for me at least anyway, the Gun Gale Online arc was the absolute lowest point the series had fallen, and, surely, for how incredibly awful that arc was, there would be nothing else that could possibly be as bad, and as I witnessed the next two story arcs the series had to offer,
was content in the assumption I had made. As such, when the announcement for the latest addition to the series arrived, a film of the Ordinal Scale arc, while not expecting too much, was, at the very least, hoping for something that was entertaining. For me, something that is ""bad"" is not inherently a game breaker as long as I can derive some kind of entertainment from the piece I am consuming (it's the same reason I kept watching Hand Shakers after all!). However, when I finally got a chance to see the film at my local cinema  I was immediately transported back to Gun Gale Online, and all of the problems I had with that arc. It was like a World War II survivor being shown film of the war again. It was horrifying. To put it bluntly, Sword Art Online: Ordinal Scale, is awful, and may be the most illogical and poorly written entry in the series thus far, and that’s saying a lot when taking into account the franchise's now seemingly unanimous hatred from much of the community! There are so many things that this movie does wrong, and of course, keeping in style with previous entries into the series, is essentially the living embodiment of wasted potential, and I think that's what annoys me most about SAO in general. The series has interesting ideas from time to time, and in some instances, such as in Gun Gale, when given the opportunity to develop Kirito, it's unfortunately glossed over. And that's the impression I get of Ordinal Scale. It feels like everything that could have been interesting got pushed to the side.
To properly discuss the various elements at fault in the narrative, a quick summary of its contents:
A new game in the world of Sword Art Online has gained insane popularity, using a cutting-edge piece of technology called the ""Augma"". Wearing such a device creates a virtual world out of the real one, in which players can interact with, as well as play games within this world in order to earn in-game currency. This currency can then be used to, for example, purchase cakes at local shops or be used to earn discounts on over goods (be it clothing, or gadgets), which results in the game becoming insanely popular. However, the bosses from Sword Art Online begin to appear and battle against the players, whereupon the viewer learns that, if one who is defeated by said boss just so happens to be a surviving member of the aforementioned game, then their memories will be completely wiped! As is the case with our main girl, Asuna! Now, with a basic narrative, which is inherently fine on its own, there is a lot to discuss. Firstly, let's discuss the impracticality of the Augma as a piece of technology.
For starters, the game requires you to play with this device outside and to utilise your own body in order to fight off against the monsters you see before you, as you place the technology over your face (much like the Nerve Gear in SAO). The idea is that the players, with this technology equipped, can see the virtual world and monsters presented within it, and those without, cannot, and since the game requires the players to be running around and swinging their arms about, then your average person would just be seeing a bunch of man-children screaming as they fight off against seemingly nothing! It's an image I had while watching the film that made me laugh as it is quite frankly, silly. In addition to this, while playing the game, the player is not aware of the physical world around them, and, let's say if they go to punch an enemy in the game (in which only they can see!), in the real world they could easily punch a random pedestrian without even being aware! Thankfully, in this world, it seems nobody travels outside, as this problem never seemed to be brought into fruition. It seems everyone in the real world disappears once the players begin their flailing.  Even more problems arise when you think about the dangers the players themselves are in while in the game. What about if they think they’re running to a dragon or something, a good sixty meters in front of them but instead they proceed to run into open traffic and get run over? And I know the writer even thought of this possibility himself because during the scene in which Kirito goes to a university lecture and remarks to the lecturer that there are problems with the technology, the lecturer responds by asking him, “Is this an issue with the road accidents?” or something along those lines. As such, it leaves me to believe that there have been plenty of incidents while wearing and playing this game, and the fact that the player is completely unaware of his or her surroundings makes me wonder why anyone would willingly want to play the game out of fear of an incident occurring. Hell, a random passer-by could easily steal items out of their pockets, or even worse since they’re practically undefended!
""LIQ, you always nitpick these small little things. Why does it even matter?""
Perhaps you're right, imaginary voice in my head in which thinks of counter-arguments to my points so I can provide justification against them. Perhaps I am being pedantic in my criticisms, and just looking for stuff to complain about because indeed I am talking about SAO. A series so overtly hated at this point, that people begin groaning when they see another video on YouTube criticising the series. However, the reason why I was so distracted by such little effort in creating something that feels ""real"" or ""believable"" was because the film bored me to death, and when I'm bored, my mind thinks of such things.
Boredom. There in lies my main problem with the film, and the main reason in which every element felt so contrived to me. As a result of this boredom, another problem with the technology that bugged me began to arise: there was no clear limitations of what it could or couldn't do. For example, when attacked by an enemy in the game, some people are perfectly okay, while others are thrown back or respond to pain when being hit by an enemy. They’re nothing more than CPUs, right...? How can they issue any pain whatsoever, more so have any ability to physically move a person? When a player is hurt by these enemies and is thrown through the air, does their real-life body also fly back? The character in the digital world's movements are dictated by the actions of the player in the real world, so it doesn't make any sense. It’s just incredibly inconsistent.
This lack of clear limitations regarding the mechanics of the game also extends to the abilities of the players. For example, one of the antagonists in the film was capable of pulling off all of these amazing manoeuvres by bouncing off the walls at great speeds, which, if this were a video game in which a player used some kind of gaming peripheral such as a controller would be understandable, this element begins to make less sense when you remember that this game is controlled by the player physically moving their bodies! It's just silly to imagine that anyone could realistically be able to do such a thing, and it ends up pulling me out of the film because my suspension of disbelief shatters.
Moving along to Kirito, one thing I always praised about Gun Gale Online, despite my obvious disdain for that arc, was that they attempted to do something new with Kirto's character. His short battle with PTSD was, in my opinion, the most interesting thing to ever happen to his character, and while the pay off for this is incredibly weak, at least there was an attempt! A gold star for effort, if you will. In Ordinal Scale however, Kirito is perhaps at his most bland, and that's saying something for an already bland character. Kirito's purpose in this narrative is simple: he is the hero who saves the day and that's it. We never learn anything new about him as a person nor are there any attempts at trying to give him any more of a personality. He feels like an empty shell. While initially I was ready to throw Ordinal Scale some praise as it presented Kirito as the weakest player of this new game, thereby placing him in a position in which he is not the strongest at all times, and even resulting in a somewhat charming scene in which he falls flat on his face in an attempt to be cool, unfortunately this element is only used for comedic purposes.
Kirito’s lack of strength means nothing in the grand scheme of things since he gains power pretty quickly, becoming the number one player with little to no effort, and is used more so to pad out the story otherwise Kirito would have defeated the antagonist in their first encounter. Having Kirito be the weakest, and having him struggle and work hard to gain power in order to save his girlfriend would have given the narrative a greater sense of sincerity and heart as well. I may have found myself rooting for Kirito, as he is the underdog in this tale for once, but unfortunately the narrative opts for its roots of having him be overpowered and that's all. Watching the film, I can somewhat understand where I believe the script was going regarding his character: that of a directionless guy who has to finally decide what to do with his life. This is evident by the fact that he seems even more melancholic than what we are used to, and by the fact that he is taking a while in choosing a college course to attend. I really want to find the pieces here, and I really want to like Kirito, but I simply can't, as, even with these tiny details, Kirito feels more so like a robot than a character.
Asuna’s character in the film acts as the focal point of interest for the audience, being that she loses her memory of her time in Sword Art Online. Their relationship is pivotal in holding together much of the emotional weight of the narrative, due to the fact that we see both of them at the beginning of the film promise to each other that they’ll see the stars together; something that is shattered as a result of this loss of memory. Asuna's struggle with her memory loss is honestly the only element that kind of held my interest. Seeing her experience some form of PTSD when being cut down  by the antagonist, or when she breaks down and cries alone after losing her memories, adds some layers of depth onto her character, and while it is nothing extraordinary, it also adds some kind of drama to the narrative.
Perhaps my biggest gripe with the narrative was the use of exposition. Exposition is inherently not a bad thing, and, in fact, is a pivotal element in every narrative to allow the viewer to understand the world they are presented with. However, what's important is the way in which the exposition is delivered. Have the exposition be delivered in such a way to naturally allow the viewer to learn and gauge things by themselves. Perhaps use the cinematography and framing to convey ideas. Perhaps slip small pieces of information in conversations between characters that build on our established knowledge of the context of the world. There is an infinite number of ways to handle exposition, but the one most common, as it requires little effort, is when simply a character monologues, or flat out tells the viewer everything! And indeed, SAO: Ordinal Scale opts for this kind of delivery. As such, it makes the script come across as lazy and not very well thought out, as the viewer is subjected to large sections dedicated to simply telling us what is happening. While certainly not as prevalent in Gun Gale, Ordinal Scale makes use of plenty of cafe scenes in order to deliver such exposition, which, as previously mentioned, not only makes these scenes drag on, but the inherent framing that comes with a cafe scene is visually boring too.
The villains of this film are also incredibly poor. Both antagonists, Eiji, a surviving member of SAO, and Tetsuhiro Shigemura, a professor and father to a girl called Yuna, wish to bring this girl back to life. They believe the way in which to resurrect her is by extracting memories of the SAO survivors through the technology already discussed. While this is indeed a fine motivation, its ultimately undercut by how little emotional weight this carries. As a viewer, we have no reason to care for these people, or the deceased girl, as we know nothing about them. Who cares if they do not succeed? We are given no reason to do so, nor are their characters well-written enough to elicit such emotions of sympathy in me.
Moreover, as their targets are specifically that of SAO survivors, it doesn't make much sense to have the bosses be that from the game as a means to attract them. Perhaps it may act as a deterrent and stop people from even going as it brings along memories of that time in which they witnessed thousands of people die, and thus, be fruitless. However, I am willing to accept the possibility that, of course, some SAO survivors perhaps may have gotten over such trauma, as it has been four years, and will use such opportunities as a means of getting over their past nightmares, which I believe could have been an interesting angle, but is unfortunately never used.
As Kirito believes it be wrong for the survivors of SAO to forget their memories, as it would mean they're also forgetting the people that they lost, perhaps an interesting narrative thread would have been to have the antagonist play a direct contrasting ideology to Kirito's. Perhaps the antagonist could argue that it's in fact great for the SAO players to forget as they can move on with their lives. This would have given Kirito a greater sense of purpose in this narrative, and allowed the viewer to see the advantages of two ideologies. As such, we are not subjected to Kirito's stance, which the film propagates as the morally ""correct"" one, rather that the film allows the viewer to think for themselves, and would have given Kirito's rivalry towards the villain a greater sense of authenticity. It's not only about physically besting the villain, but also a journey of understanding them too, making each party all the more human.
I've talked at length about what this film ""could have been"", and offered many ways in which I think it could have been made interesting, but in doing so, I don't mean to suggest that I am a good writer, or my ideas are of any greater value than those presented. Simply, all my own interpretations of how Ordinal Scale could be good stem from my frustration with it: mainly its wasted potential.
Hell, even Kayiba makes an appearance in the film, and just like every encounter we’ve had up with him up to this point, all he does is spout off some random vague existential nothingness and off he goes! While it does add some introspection into his character, as he remarks that he too used to think like the father whom is trying to revive his daughter, suggesting some kind of growth or awakening, we don’t learn anything else. Ultimately Ordinal Scale’s narrative and character fails due to a lack of focus, and I believe that's the keyword here. ""Focus"". Ordinal Scale feels as if a team of over twenty writers had ideas for a story, and instead of choosing one or two concrete ideas and developing them, chose to use every single unique idea. The result is a rather confusing mess of ideas and concepts that never really mesh together, nor play out in any interesting way.
Now, that’s not to say that the film is ultimately worthless however. There were a few moments I kind of liked in fact! SAO’s visuals and music has always been pretty strong (for the most part anyway) and this is where the film excels best at. The film looks good from a visual perspective, and the final action sequence was one I certainly did enjoy! Another small detail I liked was a short two second visual in which we see Asuna fly up in the air to get ready for an attack. Overlayed on her stance, one can see an image of Yuuki, who then aids Asuna in her fight. It’s a sweet little exchange, and while it was mainly included for some forced manipulation of the FEEELS I’d imagine, it works on me anyway since these two are the only two characters with some semblance of actual emotional investment; I admit I smiled when I saw that! You know what other moment made me smile? An uncensored shot of Asuna’s nipples while she was bathing. Now THAT was worth the price! I did notice a few instances of CGI however, which did kind of break my immersion in a couple of places, used mainly in the final scene of the film with some of the designs of the monsters, and in a shot where Kirito is on the phone to Asuna on his bike, where CGI pedestrians are used in the background, but it’s nowhere near the worst case of CGI I’ve seen before. The music is also good too (albeit somewhat generic and forgettable in my opinion), and I honestly really do like Yuna’s character design as well!
In conclusion, Ordinal Scale was a massive mess of ideas and concepts thrown into a blender. While, upon reflection, I wouldn’t consider Ordinal Scale to be as bad as Gun Gale Online (for that was not only much longer, filled with more plot convenience and didn’t have nearly as good animation) it was certainly nothing to raise the bar for the series, and at this point my expectations are so low that they’re right next to Dinosaur bones! It’s essentially a movie for the fans of the series, with constant call backs to earlier instalments in the franchise and the such, which is not inherently a bad thing to be, but it doesn’t excuse all of the problems I had in regards to the script. Now, I'm not here to degrade anyone who likes Sword Art Online. I believe doing such a thing anyway is dumb, and rather counter-intuitive if we all want to be open to different perspectives. Like previous instalments, the reason why I feel such irritation towards Ordinal Scale is, again, the wasted potential. The ingredients are here. It's just a shame a chef who doesn't know how to cook made the meal.",Negatif
"I'm going to analyze this movie with pros and cons in bullet point. THIS RA- REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.
+Fantastic action in the first boss raid. There were gunners on the balconies, melee dps fighters taking shots, tanks tanking shots, sufficient logic of boss moves and specials, and they formulated a strategy towards the end of the fight considering they were ragtag players and not an actual raid party. Very fun!
+Good environmental destruction animation throughout. The flames, the rocks flying, the smoke, and all that stuff was well animated. I especially liked that scene where Klein jobbed, with the integration of his HUD heightening our emotional connection
with his despair.
+The final boss' design met my expectations of what a final boss should look like: graceful yet menacing, a sense of beauty as she is the guardian of her garden and temple.
+I love the soundtrack and insert songs. They are right up my alley from upbeat j-pop idol songs to slower ballads; the volume dynamics used with a few noise tracks to create tension and boding.
+The background art and CGI of the AR transformation are pretty slick. This is easy mode, though; the weather is sunny for the week of this movie's timeline; and the fantasy setting is standard medieval meets magic with a blood-red colour pallete.
+Kirito and Asuna's romance moves forward in a meaningful way. The set-up is that they planned an outing into the countryside, but the plot kicks in and the trip is in danger of being cancelled! In addition, the memories they made together is being endangered! I genuinely felt for their relationship at all points throughout the movie, and I got a satisfying payoff.
+There are a few standout cinematography moments sprinkled throughout. I liked Asuna's nightmare where the faces got blurred out to represent loss of memory, and when she woke up with the camera blurry as if we were waking up back to reality; a few POV camera shots when Kirito was looking around for the AR ghost were utilized as needed; and I liked the seemless integration of the HUD into several POV shots to visualize how cool the Augma is.
+Drones are a thing!
+Asuna's hair was amazing!
+Nice foreshadowing in this one scene where Kirito visits a future site of conflict. Very beautiful place fitting of the fantasy setting.
+I was invested in the mystery during the first half of the movie, before it falls apart as we try to piece the given answers together.
-The prologue before the title card is just recap using TV footage.
-The AR exposition is boring and unimaginative. They choose to use a news segment to explain the various functions of the Augma and how it got popular; the clips used to highlight its functions are generic and uninspiring as if the audience was the mainstream instead of fans of the franchise. (It is implied that you should watch the first 50 episodes of SAO first before this movie... otherwise you'd have no interest or you're watching in the wrong order.)
-Um... idols! She comes in, buffs the players, and sings music... because the producers needed to sell some music! It felt very silly, but I guess that's why they did it.
-It feels lazy when most of the bosses were recycling SAO monster designs. ""Hey, we worked very hard on these boss designs, so let's use them in the movie instead of coming up with original monsters!"" The excuse is that SAO and Ordinal Scale are doing a collab. I also really hate the plant venus-fly-trap monster; that thing just really irritates me.
-The entirety of act 2 is boring.
-Heavy exposition is dumped using dialogue in uninteresting areas. Kirito and Asuna would meet up, then awkward silence would ensue whenever they weren't talking about the plot. They'd sit in their Aincrad house, or at a cafe (that's outside!), or at a restaurant, or on the street.
-On that point, whenever there is dialogue, the animation comes to a stand still. There is a basic camera encomposing two characters at opposite ends of the frame and they have a standoff with only their mouths moving for a whole minute. Often, the director would cut to scenery where background characters and butterflies would move for no reason other than looking pretty while you listened to people talking.
-For almost 40 minutes, it feels like nothing important happened. There is a lot of waiting around transitioning to the next scene and ""tension-building"" pauses to elongate scene time.
-How many times have I got to see Kirito cook? Slice of life can have it's moments, but not three times of the exact same animation loop with nothing in between.
-As much as I like how Kirito depended on his connections to get to the bottom of this mystery, it is still uninspiring to have plot points dumped onto him via phone calls and using the internet. I like the few times he had to physically confront certain characters, but others do work for him and I didn't feel like he earned every new information.
-There are about 4 boss raids in total before the finale, and each one diminshes in importance and entertainment. They got repetitive (using stock footage of the AR transformation of the city) and gets less impressive quickly.
-Plotholes, a whole lot of them. It's like trying to drive on a road where any pothole will lead to instant death.
-Okay, so in order to obtain the memories of SAO survivors playing Ordinal Scale, the victims had to be cut down during the collab boss raids because the SAO monsters would remind them of their time in the death game and trigger an emotional response, letting the Augma calculate the location of those memories inside the brain, scan them, and extract them. Instead of being able to copy them (because why not? high-tech can mean anything), extraction leads to (ir)reversible damage to those sections of the brain. You would think that this would be permanent, until the main villains say they can give them back by reverse scanning..... this does not make any physical sense so I'm going to pretend this is all magic (or fictional science, or whatever).
-""We need solid evidence before we can sue the company that makes Augma."" Can't we just reverse engineer the Augma and find out that it's just the Nervegear but with certain functions replaced? You can wear them and still full-dive? Isn't full-diving dangerous as lectured by the professor? It can perform a radiation scan to the brain just like the Nervegear, but instead of killing you, it just extracts (and destroys your) memories. All this thinking of how it works is mindwrecking and I'm just going to call this plot technology magic.
-You expect me to believe that Kirito does a training montage, that in the course of 24 hours, will increase his physical abilities and Ordinal Scale level so that he can be on even footing with Eiji? What the fuck.
-Let's go to an idol concert, she only plays one song, then you all must do a boss raid but this time they will overpower you while the exits are locked. They're not even indestructible because they get destroyed later on! You have to fight the final boss by full-diving back into ALO just because! Earn this special weapon that one-hits anything! WHY DOES THIS NUMBER NEEDS TO REACH 10000 TO TRIGGER A THING (THAN JUST TRIGGERING IT EVERY TIME SOMEBODY GETS 0 HP'D)? WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
-Terrible use of villians.
-Eiji was the perfect foil to Kirito: a fellow SAO survivor who didn't get put down in history because he did jack in Asuna's guild so he carries around a ""bible"", so to speak, a reminder that he was insignificant and also as a revenge list containing the names of who he hates; in the two years between SAO and Ordinal Scale, he trained his body and grew quite a bit taller so that when he lays the smackdown, I believe he can easily overpower Kazuto in real life; he lost his only (female) friend in the game and wishes nothing but despair for everybody involved. There was potential for an ideological dialogue between the two where their values could be tested as they try to one-up each other. There was none, then he got his ass handed to him because the plot said so.
-The professor guy had a believable motivation of bringing back his deceased daughter through constructing an AI and inserting memories of her time in SAO. I mean, this would result in a totally different person but at least she'd be a bit more human. This idea was okay, until the very end of the movie when he decides to betray Eiji because he had the most memories of her. So I get that to construct her he needs memories of all the SAO survivors who ever had contact with her, and this leads to using a blanket strategy with total disregard. This is totally evil, but it turned an otherwise potentially morally gray character to just a one-dimensional black villian who, at the end of the day, needs have his plans be ruined by Kirito.
-Act 3 is ridiculous and stupid.
-So Kirito goes up to Eiji, confronts him, and smacks his ass. I have two problems with this scene: I already mentioned the stretch of disbelief with Kirito buffing himself up overnight; instead of a fistfight like what I would have done, they activate Ordinal Scale and perform a terribly choreographied swordfight. I get that this scene is happening concurrently with the idol concert upstairs, but then the backstory of the professor also gets interspersed in this fight. Yes, you should definitely talk during the fight so he knows where you are and parry your attacks! All tension is lost as the fight is resolved rather quickly. There's also this unneccessary augmentation device that gets destroyed by Kirito and lets him get the upper hand... Eiji is already an atheletic guy in real life, so why the fuck is this plot device ruining this fight for???
-The adult government enforcers are also dumb as bricks. ""Let's just let Kirito handle this."" Bitch no, people are trapped in the stadium and would like to be let out. Maybe the doors are soundproof or something. They even go up to the balcony and open the door with a bullet to the control panel (stupid cliche), then they can see down into the situation. They could have opened the doors on their way down to the lower floors!
-I don't have a problem with the AR ghost that led Kirito around throughout act 2, but then she shows up via deus ex machina and tells Kirito what to do in order to save the day, and he just does it without question because he trusts her just because.
-The final boss fight is not as hyped as I thought it would be. I would think it's because it is obvious that Kirito and co would defeat it, but it also feels short and unimpactful due to repetitiveness from previous fights. The boss lady herself is fun and exciting, but the way they defeat it is predictable and cheesy. Basically, they dive into ALO and everybody (whose function is to be a cameo) are able to come together and defeat it. Also to note is that the action happens too fast and everybody only has less than 2 seconds to show off. No strategy involved, just keep attacking it is over.
-I mentioned that the boss monsters are not indestructible. I would have programmed them to be and I'd get that special number 10000 to trigger my brain melt attack, but the hack weapon for some hack reason turns that flag off and I wouldn't be able to drain memories from my despairing victims. Bad logic.
Quick explanation of scores:
Animation 7 - Beautiful background art and action choregraphy, but terrible directing and cinematics for most of the runtime.
Sound 8 - Lovely OST, catchy insert songs, and I like LiSA. Good volume dynamics in certain scenes, and good sound effects work make the action passable.
Characters 3 - Kirito and Asuna's relationship was meaningful. Other than that, nothing of interest worth mentioning. Klein gets jobbed really hard.
Story 2 - Stupid, stupid, stupid.
Enjoyment 6 - Fun, fun, fun!
Overall 4 - Because MAL makes me assign numbers to categories even though they should not be weighed equally.
I don't hate this movie. It just falls apart by itself if you start thinking about it. I don't care about recommending it. I just wanted to ra- review it.",Negatif
"Sword Art Online has never really been my type of anime but I can see the appeal for a lot of people.  So when I was invited to see the movie, I walked in with low expectations and unfortunately lived up to them.
Story: 3
SAO never had the strongest of plots and this movie is no different. Kirito and friends are once again thrown into a new game which ends up another fight for their lives only this time, it takes place in the real world using augmented reality. Besides from being generic and predictable, most of it barely made any sense. SAO never fails
to impress me on how far I should suspend my disbelief but this movie takes the cake on how often I questioned the choice in writing for some parts especially towards the end. It's lazy writing at its best where things just conveniently work out.
There's also a romantic side plot between Kirito and Asuna if you're into that but it barely goes anywhere. But at least it wasn't a harem.
Art: 9
It's A1 Pictures and their most popular series. Of course it's going to look good for a movie. The animation team really went all out for the fight scenes making them as flashy as possible while making it easy to follow. Definitely one of the few things that is good in SAO. This would have been a 10 if they didn't use some really cheap CGI for some of the minor monsters but the main fights are beautifully animated.
Sound: 7
SAO is also pretty decent when it comes to sound design and music. The fights sounded pretty good and voice acting suited the characters. They were able to incorporate some of the music through a new character who acts as the game's mascot/idol. It did get kinda old after the second time she appeared and sung but it's a part of the generic plot.
Characters: 2
It's the same old cast of Kirito and his friends which are all generally shallow and one-dimensional. The movie does do a good job at showing who these characters were for people who aren't too familiar with the series. Fans will appreciate these familiar faces appearing again as they tried to cram as many as they could into the movie.
The new characters are fairly generic but my biggest gripe is with the main villain. They tried to make him seem justified in his actions but he just comes off as dick for no reason. Yet at the same time, there isn't enough to hate or love the character and ends up feeling completely useless to the plot.
All of the characters had very weak to no motive in their actions. The writers were trying to go the emotional route to connect to the audience more but I'm left feeling disconnected because the characters barely act human at all.
Enjoyment: 4
I enjoyed the action scenes in the movie and how ridiculous the writing got but the fact that there are more holes than swiss cheese in the plot just made it frustrating to watch. I sat there asking myself ""why?"" throughout the film and got to the point where I wasn't even amazed anymore with its lackluster writing. The actions scenes have been the main selling point of SAO so at least those are good.
There is a lot of small details that fans of SAO will appreciate and enjoy but fanservice can't hide these plot holes.
Overall: 5
Sword Art Online The Movie: Ordinal Scale suffers the same faults as the series with its badly written story and poorly developed characters. I do think the movie is better since it's only like two hours long and they weren't able to drag things out forever. I wasn't expecting this movie to ""fix"" what was wrong with the series but I can't fault what makes SAO so popular. Fans will love this movie, even though it technically isn't the best. It checks out every box on how a SAO movie was suppose to be and I'd be surprised if they broke away from this.",Negatif
"This review contains spoilers
I just watched finish SAO : OS. I'm not gonna lie... It sucked. Big time. I hated the story quite a bit. It's really cliche,with the basic premise being so predictable and plain that it could be summarized in one sentence : villain wants to use AR to steal people's memories and revive his daughter, but has his plan foiled by Kirito at the last second. The villain is basically a second Kayaba, but this time he has like the ""I'll sacrifice anything to save the one I love "" motivation. The motivation of the antagonist(s) aside, almost everyone in the
movie was bland. The plot holes of the movie are numerous and often times ridiculous. For instance, I'm kinda pissed at how Yuna couldn't tell Kirito about the professor from the get go. Like why do you even bother to jump-scare Kirito and point mysteriously at a direction and then suddenly disappear? If she was really against the professor's plans, she could have just said ""my dad is like, stealing people's memories and shit to revive me. "" And Kirito would be like ""Really? Geez let's go call the cops on him to prevent the completely predictable lost of Asuna's memories and avoid all that random drama"" The plot armour of this show is also not on the lower side of the spectrum. I'm not even gonna mention how it only took Kirito a few minutes (a few hours in movie time) to jump 1000+ in rank. In the end, the thing I learnt from the story is ""Go and exercise, you fat shit ""
I just want to put it out there that I'm not an SAO hater. I genuinely enjoyed GGO (first half) quite a bit. Franky though, out of all the SAO sequels, I hate this one the most",Negatif
"We see the entire SAO survivor roster return to the big screen as they face a new foe, will they overcome what lies ahead?
Ordinal Scale, a very highly anticipated movie (for me at least) that would hopefully revive a once great series to me. After the monstrosities we call GGO, Alfheim and Death Gun took all enjoyment of mine away.

STORY: 3
I have no words for this steaming pile of horse shit that the writers decided to pass off as a plot for a movie. There is absolutely no effort, no depth in Ordinal Scale's story and it's absolutely appalling. We've all seen
cookie cutter plots but in Ordinal Scale there is no effort put into even slightly making the story their own. Listening to the story trying to explain itself scientifically  was also a a terrible failure. A VR headset that gains full control of your nerves and can kill you via microwaves? Ok, I can dig it. Yui is a string of code that can coexist alongside the main heroes? Yea, she's a cute child character thing, keeping it PG-13 I guess, go for it. Guy shoots gun through VR headset to kill you? Ok, wtf... and it only goes more downhill. Funny thing is, the Ordinal Scale story makes the flat earth theory seem logical (not really funny if you payed to watch) Alongside the atrocious writing are the literally tens, hundreds even thousands (not really thousands) of plot holes that destroy the story to a point where watching mars of destruction makes sense. The beginning makes no sense, the buildup makes no sense and the end makes no sense. You know what, EVERYTHING in between makes no sense and its painful to say that this is by far the worst SAO story to date.
You may thing it ends there but, sadly you're mistaken. There is no sense of where the writers wanted the story of SAO:OS to go, the sheer amount of directional blindness is overwhelming even to a kid like me who passed with 70's (mind you, high 70's) during my literature courses. These writers are getting paid to do this but i'd put more effort in for a new pair of shoes and a warm room to spend my nights. The writers can't even decide on whether the current situation in the movie is a romance scene, drama or action. I swear it's like they hoped that combining all genres of anime would make for a good movie. Writing isn't everything, but it is arguably the most important aspect of a cinematic piece if you want it to be even slightly good, sadly for SAO:OS there is a complete lack of a good story, or possibly a story at all.
(I'm so harsh, I know.)
ART: 9
What can I say? SAO has always had stunning visual effects. All the fight scenes are well choreographed and well animated. There is no lack of detail in any scene from what my memory serves from watching it an hour or 2 ago. But it's a movie, of course it's going to be stunning visually, that's the staple for anime movies nowadays. You don't get a pat on the back for doing pretty much the bare minimum SAO. I'm not a fan at all of the use of CGI in anime but it was scarce and probably is the only reason why my art rating is 9 and not 10.
SAO is very visually appealing but art is not the only reason to watch an anime, be weary. (Stay woke)
SOUND: 6
I love LiSA, her music is probably why I listen to J-Pop and pretty much J-Anything to this day. Crossing field sprung my heart into motion and changed me as a person. Although all of the music during battles and random singing sequences was good, the audio BALANCING was absolutely horrendous. One moment SAO:OS sound like a movie long attempt at a ASMR video and the next it's ear turning gut wrenching ear-rape that causes half the audience to cover their ears and their children's for their own safety. Truly a failure on the sound balancing team's fault but for that alone it can ruin a whole movie, even ruin a whole person's life if they're even remotely susceptible to hearing loss.
Like epilepsy warnings, SAO:OS needs some sort of sound warning as blood was mere moments from spurting our of my ears.
CHARACTERS: 3
Oh boy, here it is. All the characters in SAO are stale, not just OS but SAO in general. There is nothing special about these characters especially the main villain of OS. The main villain was so mind-numbingly stupid that I was forced to mentally push him aside for the whole story once you learned of his motives. Motives similar to many, MANY characters beforehand from other anime, but you can't feel any pity or remorse in this villains voice or in his actions. He is pretty much becomes a plank of dry wood that longs to be ignored. Nothing clever was given to any of the main characters or villains to make then even somewhat interesting. As much as I love Asuna because of s1 I find it impossible to like her as much because of the lack of creative thinking between the writers. Having characters stick to their old habits and ways is in no way a bad thing, but if they start of stale and end off stale-er then there calls for some changes. It's laughable to even think that some higher ups of the company looked at this and thought ""Yes these boring characters seem right"" and told them it was A OK to send 'em off to the theaters. Even the cast of the s1 SAO returns and their ""character traits"" are completely the same. That being that they have none. SAO believes that having a hobby such as raising a pet or enjoying to smith weaponry can constitute an entire characters existence. News Flash: NO THATS NOT HOW IT WORKS, fix your characters.
Kirito is emo as always and all the fangirls enjoy that for some reason but 1 reason why CHARACTERS isn't a 1 is because they were able to make 1 love scene memorable for me, at least.
ENJOYMENT: 5
This would be lower but through sheer fan service (Asuna's and Kirito's lame excuse for a romance) AND (Their signature attacks) I enjoyed the fighting, er.. I mean, movie more than a should have. When you watch SAO either turn your brain off and look at the pretty art and characters or think critically and see what SAO:OS really is, a poorly made SAO based movie.
Maybe it's because i've been let down so many times before by SAO's team, but I watched the entire movie critically thinking instead of enjoying what should've been a fuck popcorn flick with some pals.
OVERALL: 5
Art really brought this up, lol.
Overall SAO is good for the casual anime watcher and if that's who you are, there's nothing wrong with that. We all start somewhere.
Although it is hard for me to recommend to anything with beyond basic anime knowledge it was a cool experience that I probably regret somewhere in my heart.
R.I.P. my 12$
TL;DR
Poor story and characters
Unbalanced sound effects with good music
Beautiful art
Would recommend to casual anime watchers and SAO fanboys/girls
Would not recommend to anyone else
Just please don't rate it a 10 near me, I might have a fit.
and by might I mean will.

"First of all, I did not hate Ordinal Scale, I just want to clear that up. SAO as a series has always been accompanied by great music. OS definitely lives up to that in my mind. OS also kept up the amazing dungeon designs that SAO does well. (As a person that is being a GM for D&D, I enjoy that)
It also was interesting to see how they dealt with the switch from VR to AR, and the problems that the VR community would deal with by having most of their people spend their time in AR.
And my final comment for what it did well,
it didn't leave the villain's intentions ambiguous...
Continuing on to my critiques, while watching, I felt more obligated to watch it than actually enjoying it. The story felt rushed. Having written scripts for shows before, they did a lot of ""Telling"" (there is a technique called ""Show don't Tell"" where you explain back story and motivations through the story occurring rather than saying it out loud.)
There were attempts at foreshadowing, with the robots, but they didn't develop it enough and focus on the symbols enough to give the viewer enough time to be able to recognize it
OS also had some problems with their characters, primarily, their villains.
Despite them being intelligent, they are naive. This doesn't make them interesting.
Also, although it was cool to watch, Kirito was too OP at the end. Seriously.
For anyone that actually read my review of Ordinal Scale, thank you for your time.
-Silver King",Negatif
"As someone who got into anime thanks to SAO I couldn't help myself but to watch this movie. I didn't really want to expect much but the rating and many positive reviews got my hopes up, yet it disappointed quite a lot.
Story 2/10
The begining of the movie is promising but the rest of the story is a big downfall. The concept of mixed reality with VR is unique and there are a lot of paths the anime could continue from but it becomes your typical cliché where main protagonist gets from zero to hero in only 24 hours, is extremly overpowered and adults just let
him handle everything even though there are many lives at stake.
The plot feels really empty, there many filler scenes like Kirito's cooking, Asuna's bath scene, when they were in café and played pacman to win a cake or singing Rika. There is no progress whatsoever, not even in characters. It's also dump how Kirito always ignores Yuna when she points somewhere.
Unfortunatly fights get repetive and you have already seen them in first two seasons just in different colours. If you had deja vú in at least one fight then it's because the choreography was already used before. The final fight has no impact at all because of how poorly was the story developed and how there were trown many side characters that were shown only maybe once or twice in the story and on top of it only in TV. The final deus ex machima sword fighting isn't even worth mentioning in my opinion.
(Also my friend loved how everyone always dies in one hit but the final boss apparently isn't that strong)
Characters 3/10
Don't expect much of character development here and characters stay one-dimensional. But the concept of new characters is reasonable, interesting but as with the story, wasted. The idea of Eiji's backstory and motive is well made, but that's probably it. What i did like though is the white design for Yuna. Kirito hasn't changed a bit same as his harem.
Visuals 7,5/10
Clean and bright colours are nice to watch and the animation of final fight was outstanding, together with good music being only reason not to drop it. Unfortunatly, good visuals are not enough for a show to be good. It's really hard to enjoy it, when there's so little of story and characters acts sometimes unnaturally.
Overall 4/10
If you want to see Kirito cooks or waving his sword in the air to IK monsters, you can probably enjoy, but if you expect some progress in the series, don't watch it, by the end of the week I already forgot almost everything that happend, there's no other coffee soda stucked in your head or some memorable fight scene as with Gleam Eye. I give it 4/10 only because I liked the first seasons when I started with anime but it probably deserves less.",Negatif
"I told myself that SAO is bad only because Kawahara wrote the LN series during a time when he didn't care about quality that much. Now I can say with 100% certainty that he still doesn't. There will be spoilers in this. I'm just ranting at this point too.
Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is pretty enjoyable. The problem is that the more you think about the technicalities of the plot, the less sense it makes. This is pretty much how I felt about SAO after I rewatched it. The first time I thought it was pretty decent but after rewatches I realized it
was hot garbage. Only now that I look for these inconsistencies do I know how bad Kawahara's writing is on the first viewing.
My issues with the movie are as follows:
1) The plot makes no sense. Yuna is supposed to be an AI that is revived to a near biological sentience after taking the memories of SAO survivors. HOWEVER, Kirito is greeted by a girl who looks like Yuna that gives him hints on how to save Asuna. During the entire movie, it seemed like Yuna didn't need these memories at all. So, what's the point then?
2) Kirito manages to beat Eiji. During the beginning of the movie, it's clear that Kirito's lack of physical prowess holds him back from being a good player in Ordinal Scale. This is a good thing, because it allows us to see Kirito not as a boring and bland OP protagonist, but as someone who knows what it's like to have power taken away from them. Well, surprise surprise, but this premise is dropped half way through the movie. Kirito randomly becomes a badass again, and defeats AN AUGMENTED Eiji. Bionics that give people super strength and agility. Do you know how little sense this makes? Thanks Kawahara.
3) The sense of danger in the final act was blown out of proportion. After Yuna's concert, a bunch of monsters show up and people's first instinct is to fight them, and not take their devices off? Seriously? Way to artificially bloat danger for no reason.
4) Augmented Reality seems pretty pointless when it comes to VR-like video games. The movie tries to make Ordinal Scale seem like SAO. Why? What is the purpose of this? AR's best use is like how it is used in Accel World, helping with day to day tasks.
5) The characters outside of the main group are as one dimensional as they come. Kawahara doesn't know how to write villains. Kayaba and Sugo were both evil for the sake of it in the series. Eiji and Yuna's dad were evil to resurrect Yuna in the movie. It's stuff we've seen before. Yuna herself is pretty much a pop idol. Not much nuance there either.
I do have to give the movie credit in two areas. The first being that it didn't bore me. I was entertained. The action was pretty good throughout and the art/animation was also good. The second area would be the relationship between Kirito and Asuna. I'm glad they've gone full romance again after letting that go for multiple arcs. Seriously. The last time we saw them kiss was in the Aincrad arc. The harem stuff was awful. At least this time I can say thanks Kawahara unironically.",Negatif
"Im not the biggest SAO fan but i went into this with an open mind. Where to begin. The plot for this is so convoluted and over the top that its hilarious. Every problem in this movie can be solved with just taking off the headset. This series cant seem to get away from people who played SAO who want revenge on other people for something and are just so one dimensional. The dialogue and witty banter between the characters is so cringy you would think the writers never had a conversation with another person their whole lives. Overall the art was good but the
story and characters seem so stale and unrealistic that all revolves around a really bland plot.",Negatif
"You know, its just dawned on me. Sword Art Online, a series targeted at the teen demographic staring a self-insert blank space as a protagonist that is constantly surrounded by members of the opposite sex, all of whom could be potential partners, that is hugely popular despite having about the same critical acclaim as a slightly unclean and unflushed public toilet from everybody that isn’t a huge fan, having a reputation for being watched by people who hate it just to take the piss to the point that the series now has more negative things said about it than the series itself is probably worth
getting, receiving so much hate that at this point that most of it is probably unwarranted, but will inevitably continue so long as it remains popular.
The point I’m getting at here is that Sword Art Online is Twilight for the anime community (something that I didn’t think of myself, but I’m stealing from my brother considering it’s an excellent comparison).
Also, there is a moment at the start of the film in which Kirito asks if him and his friends are playing too much video games. Don’t be fooled into thinking this is him showing any self-awareness or character development, because its not.
Anyway, with those little gripes out of my system, I’m going to write the review now.
I wanted to like this. I honestly did. So many of the ideas here have to potential to go somewhere interesting, but then they just don’t. The AR and its gear is an interesting idea, creating something that could be a commentary into technology entering our everyday lives (a path we are already on looking something similar), and how this would affect the SAO survivors etc. Although it doesn’t explore any of this.
Making Kirito bad at the game because, realistically, somebody who would be good in VR would be unfit as shit and therefore bad in real life. This makes sense from a realistic, storytelling and tension-creating perspective. Potentially interesting? Yep. Utilized? Nope, lets just make him OP again after, like, a 2-minute montage.
Villains that are sympathetic and not just generic evil-dudes? Definitely! Explore them in an effective way at all? No can do!
And don’t even get me started on how little the plot and mechanics of this universe don’t make sense – something I’d be a little more forgiving on if any of the potential that this had to be a good movie was lived up to.
I think it’s this potential that really drags this down for me. What should have been my favourite SAO content instead almost ends up being my least favourite. I enjoyed SAO II more than the first one because I seen more effort put into the story and characters. I don’t enjoy this more because you would have to be trying to fuck this up to ruin such a potentially good premise with lots of the elements of an interesting movie at least.
Either way this concludes my SAO binge for now. I’ll maybe watch SAO III or even the GGO spin-off when these shows are completed, but it will have to be in a while because all the alcohol in the world wouldn’t convince me to spend another second of my precious-little free time watching any more Sword Art Online content for now.",Negatif
"Warning:My reviews are full of mature language most times so be advised and get the kids to the shelter in case they get offended..God the world has gone soft in the head...
Oh man how everyone howled when there were news of a new SAO movie.You could hear the screams of joy from 'Murica to the North Pole.That's how much of a stir it caused to the community and indeed the trousers of fans cause they would get to see Asuna all dressed up...You sick sick little b@stards.
But first let's take a quick glance at the history of SAO.The anime adaptation of Reki Kawahara’s light novel
series SAO originally started airing back in 2012.If you don't know how to count that's 5 years..In dog years that's eternity!The first half of the season was very good indeed while the second half was actually so bad the North Korean army used it as a biological weapon.Then after 2 years,SAO came back in 2014 with a second season,and it was even worse or better..Depends on many factors such as:""Are you a fanboy or not?""..Which brings us to 2017 and a new movie.Was to be expected really,no matter what it was a huge success..Can't think of a reason why but here we are trying to decipher this mystery.
So in goes the DVD and out goes my patience already..A new movie..A fuckin new one and there are scenes from the TV series?Why?In case i got a case of extreme memory loss?That thing there is a sign that something is going wrong.A sign it was made in a rush or that what comes next is plainly pathetic and devoid of any actual meaning.Think about it,5 mins of screen time showing nothing new.5 mins that could be used otherwise.And 5 mins doesn't sound like much in series terms but in movie terms?That a whole new level of different.
But let's dig further shall we..It's a new movie after all.Well that's what they wanted you to think cause apart from the new title and somewhat different setting all else is almost exactly the same.
So they ditched the full dive VR for a bluetooth earpiece-like thingy that enables them to feel the joys of VR with none of the drawbacks of the Amusphere.it does not require it’s users to be in a bed to operate it like the Amusphere does.What’s more,the Augma has become increasingly popular due to a new game called Ordinal Scale,in which players can use some Wii-like controllers for battles against monsters in augmented reality using their own bodies.Of course this time round if you die in the game you don't buy the farm in real life.Before every battle you also get a Pop idol singing and giving players rewards..We needed an idol in 5 mins cause there rarely are any in anime.Player's stats are regulated based on a ranking system.The higher the rank,the better the stats of said player.So when Kirito joins in on the fun he is the king of the hill right..Actually no he kinda sucks at it.Cause here he has to use his body to play the game not just lying around in a bed.From there on SAO goes full beentheredonethat mode where the game isn't what it's supposed to be and Kirito kicks arse.I cannot say much more cause i'll spoil it for ya.
So storywise then not much is all fresh and new and shiny.Just some tweaks here and there and that's it.At least animation was pretty damn good i have to say.Stunning.Take out some notsogood CGI moments and it's great.
Music and VA..VA was spot on no probs there.As for music that's a whole new kettle of fish.Cause of this pop idol i was talking about earlier.In each battle there she is singing amidst the battles.Why?Manowar was too cheesy?Well they are cheesy and disgusting but at least they are not as boring as hearing some high pitched squeaks from a pop idol.
Onto the characters..Is this the work of a ""BEST OF album"" enthusiast?Cause almost everyone from the series makes an appearance.Speaking for my self that was a stupid move.Sure fanbitches were very happy and made happy noises while playing feverishly with their private parts but for normal people it was out of place.It's like they were out of ideas  as to how to procede and thought ""oh yeah let's put some old characters there for the heck of it to justify the fact that we made a movie..""
All in all it's the same old formula with a lime twist that lasts for a really short amount of time.I can best describe the whole movie and indeed the whole franchise as fucking lazy writing.Cause no matter what,in the end it's all the same where things just conveniently work out for the characters.SAO never had the strongest of plots and this movie is no different.The only thing going for it really are the fights and the fact that it's only 2 hours long so they couldn't drag things out like in the series.If you're a fan this ticks all the boxes,if you're not though it's as interesting as drinking water from the toilet.",Negatif

"Not the SAO we needed, but the one we deserved. The franchise that launched a 1000 'trapped in a videogame' copycats gets its theatrical debut with a film that exemplifies all SAO's strengths and weaknesses.
STORY
""What if Pokemon Go could kill you?"" Taking place after the events of SAO II, a new video game craze is sweeping Japan. Using a new device called the 'Augma' that lets gamers play while fully conscious, the video game Ordinal Scale seems to have none of the inherent risks of a full-dive system. But there's a catch, because we wouldn't have much of a story if there wasn't one, now
would we? (Seriously, why hasn't the Japanese government banned these devices yet?) The story itself isn't too bad for an action film, even if I was able to guess what the last act would look like by the time I was halfway through. Granted, it isn't too good either. Be prepared for more characters sitting around eating while they dump exposition (although mercifully never for as long as some of the TV episodes). There was some potential here, such as the way the first act of the movie brings Kirito's power level down to mortal levels with a convincing explanation thus restoring a degree of tension, but then in the last act those rules and limits are simply broken because the plot demands it. If you see the plot as simply an excuse to set up cool duels and boss battles, the story is servicable. Interesting premise, hit-or-miss execution, a trademark of SAO writing.
CHARACTERS
The cast from the TV shows returns and isn't really changed. They do go through some dramatic moments, but those moments never add up to any kind of character growth. At the end of the story nobody is noticably different or has changed from what you would recognize from TV. Kirito is still Kirito, Asuna is still Asuna, all the girls in Kirito's harem still haven't figured out that Asuna won a long time ago, and I still can't name a single one of the guys in Klein's guild. The antagonists are step up from what we're used to in that they have a clear goal we can somewhat understand and sympathize with (even if their plans and motivations aren't terribly original). This film is pure SAO, it doesn't do anything the franchise hasn't already done before, although it usually gives us the best version of it.
PRODUCTION VALUES
On that line of thought, this film also brings the franchise's traditional strengths. SAO has always relied on excellent music and animation to counter its relatively weak writing and characters. LiSA is back again with the theme song 'Catch the Moment', another high-energy-but-easy-listening J-Pop song in the vein of 'Crossing Field'. The animation is excellent, although if a SAO movie had second-rate animation there might be a riot. For those of you with a knowledge of Tokyo geography there can be some bonus enjoyment in picking out which real-life location the scene is happening in. They took the best part of the TV series and bumped up the budget.
OVERALL
This movie is pure SAO, distilled into movie form and with the increased production values a movie normally entails. It is at least the best form of SAO I've seen, maximizing existing strengths and minimizing traditional weaknesses, but neither fixing the existing problems or adding any new strengths. I'm sure it's just what the fans ordered, but I'd be surprised if Ordinal Scale turned that many heads in the doubters community. As for people like me who see the SAO franchise as a decent place to get your action and sakuga fix, it's a fine movie but not a (video) game-changer.",Negatif
"I honestly can't decide if this film was great or just mediocre. Visually it was spectacular, with flawless and at times jaw-dropping animation and visual effects, which twinned with the film's amazing soundtrack made the action sequences highly immersive and win the film 'cool points'. The series also has a lot of very touching moments and some great character development which looks as though it should have a significant impact on the next upcoming series, especially since we see two main characters getting engaged at the end of the film. Another plus point is that despite being centred around video games, the plot does involve
real stakes that directly affect the characters' lives and relationships.
However, the film has a great many problems: The film's villain is a mad scientist who's trying to bring back his daughter as an artificial intelligence by stealing the memories of those who knew her in SAO and recreating her from that. In the story, he takes Asuna's memories of her time in SAO and of being married to Kirito. The issue is that instead of just targeting the SAO players with his brain scanning drones, he needlessly sets his drones to only take people's memories if they are defeated by giant monsters in game events. This is ridiculous; what kind of father would leave the prospect of saving his daughter up to the skills of video gamers at defeating monsters? He'd just suck their memories out anyway. And if their memories can be given back, as we see later on in the film, why does he even need to suck them out in the first place? And why on Earth does he plan to get all of the SAO players in one place at the concert for the climax in order to take all their memories at once if he already knows the school they attend? Why not just target the school instead of wasting an absurd amount of time, money, manpower and resources on a pointless idol concert? (with that said, both he and the other antagonist Eiji have very realistic and relatable motives and are by far the best villains in SAO despite their complete lack of common sense).
And you know how at the end of the Aincrad arc in the SAO series, Heathcliff revealed that he had always intended to become the final boss on Floor 100? Well, in this movie that gets totally retconned, since a giant female knight is revealed to have been the ""true"" final boss, in what can only be described as an enormous plot hole.
Kirito's personality has also completely disappeared in this movie, with his deep moral uncertainties discussed in SAO II being ignored altogether, in favour of a standard shonen ""getting stronger to beat the bad guy and save the girl"" mini-arc, and Kirito's coming across as rude at times, at one point driving off on his motorbike seemingly mid-conversation with Asuna and not even saying bye.
The pacing of the film is also all over the place, varying from fast and exciting to slow and dreary in the middle, often with nothing of significance happening in the slower parts of the film, which just focus on the female characters discussing pop idols.All of the supporting cast were wasted in this film, doing virtually nothing and being given no development or exploration. I also don't understand why the players of the Augmented Reality games aren't constantly bumping into non players or walking out into traffic. It also strikes me as I unrealistic that, if doctors are aware of large numbers of AU players losing their memories, this hasn't become a major health crisis and people weren't all warned about this. And since the villains knew the dead girl better than anyone else, why did they need every fragment of her from every SAO player's memories rather than just using their own memories?
Do those problems override the good? I don't really know. It has some amazing action and some really well written scenes, and it will evoke a strong emotional reaction from you... And it has almost everything I look for in a good movie... But it has a lot of problems too that almost make it hard to recommend. 5/10, watch if you're into SAO.",Negatif
"Sword Art Online Ordinal Scale is an original movie based on Reki Kawahara’s famous light novel and A-1 pictures animations of his novels Sword Art Online. The edited version is suitable for all ages looking for action-packed futuristic movies with amazing quality and plot that is easy to understand and won’t have you lost in the maze. The full version provides adults with a taste of comedic fanservice that sends whole cinema in fits of laughter. You’re able to watch this without watching the anime but it makes more sense if you have done so (and it’s definitely worth it
(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ).
The plot is set in 2026, 4 years after the Sword Art Online incident. It’s at a time when the new trendy electronic device “Augma” explodes on the market. Augma is a device worn on the head and adds augmented reality to your view. It allows you to browse the web and earn rewards in real life for doing things such as going to this specific shop to get a 10% discount storewide. Marketing and social media are what the device was most popular for, but there is a game named ordinal scale in the device that Asuna and the gang convince Kirito to play but they find it’s anything but fun for the survivors of the Sword Art Online incident...
The movie focuses on fight scenes while providing a plot that has cliche tragedic villains that are causing havoc for selfish purposes. It doesn’t linger on plot lines and prioritizes getting through to the next scene of action. During fighting scenes, it is clear what is happening, unlike marvel movies where it is just a mess of heroes vs villains. Your eyes are able to keep up with the clashing and the quality is too great that it makes the outside world seem blurry. Just like the anime series, while the engaging action scene is playing, the soundtrack that is in the background enhances the scene you’re so lost in that you don’t even know it’s there!
While the amazing animation of A-1 pictures is playing, there is one thing that annoys me, plot holes. Plot holes, some things that happen in the movie defy the law of physics, people are sent flying when it’s only an augmented reality game, WHA? They also take physical damage as well! What makes people so into this movie is the great fight scenes that A-1 pictures made but due to that, you forget that it’s just a simple storyline that can be summed up in less than 5 sentences. The protagonist is overpowered like usual so sometimes it just seems like the villains just can’t dodge and are standing there to be hit.
For the conclusion, it’s an amazing movie to watch but plot kind of ruins the animations that go along with it. The fight scenes are engaging and active but without it, the movie would be a complete failure. But then again, with long plots, people can get confused, so if you’re fine with simple plots easy to understand and love epic fights then this is a must watch for those people.",Negatif
"So. They made more Sao. Yay.
The story: 5/10
There is actually a coherent story with an actual ""Villain"" with a motivation. The story is fairly predictable, it seems fairly good at first but completely crashes down at the finale. If you think about anything for longer than 5 seconds you realise it makes absolutely no sense. How are they fighting with virtual swords in the real world? How are they able to travel at inhumane speeds IN THE REAL WORLD? That right there is the problem with this movie. Ordinal scale is set in the real world, and that completely ruins the plot(SPOILERS) since it
revolves around Sao bosses apperaing in ordinal scale, and the ex Sao players killed by them will lose their memories of sao.(WHY DO THEY NEED TO DIE? WHO KNOWS.) All the tension is gone since you realise, that to prevent this, the maincgarcters could just remove the Augma or log out. But I guess nobody ever thought of that huh. And why does everyone seem soooo terrifed of the bosses since no pain or injury can be caused in their mind. At least in Sword art online you could actually die.(SPOILERS END HERE) The antagonist is one of the ""Something kinda bad happened to me and its your fault and I will do everything in my power to correct it"" types, which just comes off as annoying and lackluster.
Music and animation: 8/10
Music and animation have alwasy been good in Sao, the animation flows nicely, music is epic, but the fight scenes lack impact, like in the original series.
Characters:3/10
I love me some character development. Too bad thismovie has bsloutely none. The characters are still empty shells who lack goals or purpose. Their relationshipes,outlook on life, opinions or percption of viryal games stays the same as always.
Enjoyment:3/10
This movie is absolutely filled with tropes, inconsitencies and just plain stupidity, with a little fanservice as a cherry on the top. If you just mindlessly watch the movie without questoning anything you might even enjoy it, or if youre a massive Sao fan.
Overall. 4.5/10
It was better than the original Sao, or the S**tshow of a season 2, but that isnt saying much. I youre die hard fan of Sao, you might (and probably will) end up liking it. It takes all that was good about Sao adn adds plot on top of it. IF you arent a big fan of Sao, dont spend money of this clusterf*** of movie.",Negatif
"Sword Art Online : Ordinal Scale, A movie  supposedly set after SAO, 2.
Let's start with the Synopsis:
In 2026, four years after the infamous Sword Art Online incident, a revolutionary new form of technology has emerged: the Augma, a device that utilizes an Augmented Reality system. Unlike the Virtual Reality of the NerveGear and the Amusphere, it is perfectly safe and allows players to use it while they are conscious, creating an instant hit on the market. The most popular application for the Augma is the game Ordinal Scale, which immerses players in a fantasy role-playing game with player rankings and rewards.
Following the new craze,
Kirito's friends dive into the game, and despite his reservations about the system, Kirito eventually joins them. While at first it appears to be just fun and games, they soon find out that the game is not all that it seems...
Story :5/10
OS (Ordinal Scale) is picked up from a very lacking point in the original anime (SAO) 's plot. A certain person getting to play the OP role. Kirito is awkwardly weak at first but gets op in the second part, which is totally BS. The plot is filled with either cringe worthy content or is downright led to a plothole. The story utilises A.I in a character but its very inadequate to the point it can't improve the story to a greater extent.
Art :7/10
Some blind fans liked the anime because lf it's so called 'Animation'. Well they definitely got reasons. A-1 picture does pretty neat work animating the movie, the art is same of SAO but improved to a year standard..
Soundtrack :5/10
Well. The soundtrack is nothing special. Its as bland as the main series, people who overhyped the movie will not like it. Certain fans will like it though. The OSTs are not so good.
Characters :4/10
How did kirito get weak? How did Kirito get stronger now? Who is this 'certain' person? (who actually leads a plothole)  and mamy other questions come up. Kirito's gang is ever bright yet useless in the movie. The only work they do is make cringing content.
Enjoyment :6/10
The enjoyment is pretty good but the last portion feels rushed to a point where cringe worthy content is plugged in. At the very last point of the last fight comes 'nostalgic' moments which is extremely childish and maybe cringe worthy. So I enjoyed it until the last part. But enjoying it doesn't mean that I like how it was executed.
Overall :5/10
Its Mediocre, a hit or miss movie,mostly an instant like for Sao fanboys/fan girls. It's execution wasn't good. It has plotholes in the leading concept that the structure is built on. I will tell by myself that this movie was going OKAY but if the ending was more better, refined and MORE mature,  it might've been a 7/10. Or, ""Finally a movie/series worth watching from the SAO franchisee'.
Thanks for reading, i hope you find this review useful. It's written with purely my opinion.  & opinion may vary from person to person!",Negatif
"Warning this review may contain spoilers.
First impressions, so I guess I am back again to review my favorite trainwreck series but now in movie format yyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. Let's just get this shit show rolling.
Story: 4/10
The film starts with our Lord and savior Kirito-sama joyfully reaping the benefits of his labors after the defeat of Death Gun, the reclaiming of the sword Excalibur and getting family permission to fuck asuna in real life. While kirito has been busy enjoying his day to day life. a new game has taken the world by a storm named Ordinal Scale a game that mergers the real-life world with virtual reality
technology. Kirito who been living under a rock lately knows nothing about this new game until asuna and the harem club tell him about it and convince him to join in on the fun. As kirito and friends join in on this new fad they soon learn that things are not as they appear with odd accidents are happening to Sao players and an even more mysterious ghost-like girl who is appearing in front of kirito. Now the scales of destiny have started tipping and it time for Kirito to do what he does best solve video game related mysteries.
So sword art online ordinal was hyped to be sword art online redemption to the mainstream crowd who have been arguably cynical about this franchise.
By fixing the problems that I myself and quite a few people have about the series as a whole and with the added bonus apparently focusing more on kirito and asuna relationship. And I be honest when I first heard that's what they were Promising I didn't really have high hopes because Star Wars online pretty much destroyed any sense of hope in me that sword art online would be considered quote-unquote good. But despite my cynicism life seems to still surprise me because this movie by in large actually delivered on what it actually promised people. Like for example kirito not being overpowered and actually focusing on kirito and Asuna relationship. Which in that regard I feel it did an ok job at that which I will go into more detail later. But other than that regard I do feel that the storyline and plot was a little underwhelming and lackluster, to say the least. The basic story and plot are basically about this dude who using the game ordinal scale to gather the memories or PTSD from the sword art online players in order to bring back his dead girlfriend Yuna as an A.I. And even if I find this idea of people using technology to download themselves Onto a computer to keep themselves alive interesting and it also kinda hints there some sort techno afterlife that's going on in the background. But The main plot falls apart when you think about how exactly is other people memories and experiences of sword art online going to bring your girlfriend back to life exactly.  Even if she in this a.l data format it still wouldn't work because those aren't her memories or her experiences and even if she had interaction with some of the people that they stole memories and experiences from it still wouldn't work because it, not her memories or experiences it's someone else  point of view  Not hers so the reasoning is pure grade bullshit. Now the kirito and Asuna relationship thing and kirito being less overpower which was quite hyped until this movie release I feel that it was a little overrated and didn't really amount to much in the grand scheme of things. Like Asuna loosening her memories and experiences from sword art online would make an interesting catalyst to test the waters of kirito and Asuna relationship because of that where they fell in love and I feel that conflict has enough emotional payoff for you to care slightly about what is going on. But at the same time, I kinda feel That it's a little overdramatized and doesn't really have much of a conflict with it.  Kirito and Asuna aren't going to break up or are going through this rough stage of their relationship because of this memory loss issue The only conflict is that maybe this memory loss thing may get worse and spread to more parts of her memories. this is where feel they fucked up because what they should have done is made her lose all her memories of kirito and the rest of that conflict was kirito trying to keep their relationship together and it would have made his quest to get her memories back by becoming the top player of ordinal scale more impactful as the way they present it in the movie  is very cringe-worthy at to say the least as there are scenes where kirito is playing and acting like a complete crazy man Because as well know video games are serious business, and if you don't take them seriously you are a newb that won't get good at games or get the girls. But besides that story wise there isn't much majorly wrong with it besides those things I mentioned.
Of course, other small nit pics I have are that the info dumps are fucking mind-numbingly boring that I would prefer to watch paint dry as these infodump scenes slow down the pacing and the fact there is multiple info dumps scene in a two-hour-ish movie just showcases how shit the writing. Also after all the shit that people went through with the sword art online and dart gun incidents, You would think that the government at this point would keep an eye on new technology that involved video games. Because guess what this new device that people use to play ordinal scale can kill you wohhhhhhh mind fucking blown and the only reason why there were no deaths is because kirito and the government stopped it before it reached that point.
Characters, 5/10
Kirito is his usual self-insert self. But this time he actually has more of a personality, And for once we actually see him struggle for a bit with a conflict that is out of his control and he actually has to try really hard to get what he wants. Like it just shows that even if he quite strong and intelligent there still things that he can't beat alone without him giving it his all. Which is nice to see but it does really amount to anything and it's just another example of sword art online classic wasted potential moments.
Another thing I want to address is Asuna is more relevant and actually shows the combat skills that made her this vice commander of the Knights of blood oath in the first place. In fact she actually a little stronger than kirito in ordinal scale and she actually even kicks quite a bit of ass. Which I liked and even after the memory loss thing they still treat her character with respect and not just some damsel in distress that needs to be saved all the time by our lord and saviour kirito Which I also like and I feel she was handled a lot better in this movie than the rape fairy arc or all of season two. Also before I move onto the side characters, I want to talk about Yuna quickly. And I like what she brings to the table it just to me she isn't that interesting and I didn't really give a shit about her anyway because I have no reason to care. So The Side characters The usual crew is back again nothing much has really changed. Except like Asuna there all made more relevant and actually do something instead of being fodder or mouthpieces until kirito shows up to rekt shit. Like they all showcase their abilities as well and it nice they have a role and do it well, Like at the end there this one scene where they all fighting this massive boss monster and they all work together to kill it and during that fight, they used teamwork and even saved each other a few times from video game death Which was nice to have. So the main villain or should I say man villains are a massive step up form. I don't know why I did this guy, rape fairly and darth gun. Eiji the dude who getting the memories for bringing his girlfriend back. His reasoning is understandable and even though he does questionable things to reach that goal.  He not evil and a bad guy he just wants his girlfriend back and even if that kinda simple and basic it's a lot better than rapey dude. And the other villain  Dr. Shigemura. He basically a dude full of guilt because he blames himself for his daughter Yuma death in sword art online because he brought her the nerve gear thing for her birthday which lead to her death. And even he is understandable and not exactly an evil person he wants to bring his daughter back to life even if he has to harm others and even if he is also basic and simple it's still 100x better than rape guy.
Art, 8/10
The animation is god tier and it looks like it was animated by the gods. The background is so clean and crip that would want to make a wallpaper out of it. There also really good CGI that doesn't clash with the animation. the fight scenes are really good and even if I find them a little too flashy for my liking. It still looks pretty cool to watch and some decent fight choreography as well, with people using teamwork or fets of combat prowess. I am not exactly a big fan of there new VR form character designs because they don't have much of a personality to them anymore and I kinda which they did. Because gun gale form had more personality to them and they looked cool because it reminded me of fallout.
Sound: 8/10
The ost, by Yuki Kajiura, was fucking amazing as always and easily one of the redeeming aspects of this movie. Even by the standard, she’s set in the past though, I was astonished to see how above and beyond she went with the quality of the soundtrack this time around. My favorite piece of this movie’s ost was probably delete, an extremely divine sounding track, making the contents of the movie feel a lot grander. It was also extremely pleasant to see that a few old favourites were revived for this movie, such as swordland All in all, ordinal scale has a lot of outstanding tracks that are amazing to listen too and do an excellent job of making the movie they go with feel like it has some weight to it, despite the actual narrative contents.
Enjoyment: 6/10
The bare-bones story and lacking characters, unfortunately, prevented me from getting really invested in the vision that this movie was trying to realize, but nevertheless, it at least gets a cookie for presentation. I really enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it to anyone who just wants a nice action movie to watch. SAO as a whole is never lacking in the spectacle department and this movie definitely brings it. The fight scenes, in combination ost, especially make for some excellent popcorn material, but other than that nothing really got my interest.
Overall: 5/10
Conclusion:
Was this the big redemption for the franchise that it was hyped up to be? Well yes and no. A lot of the series’ has had in the past major problems were taken away, but I still feel like this movie was pretty bare bones and underwhelming considering what’s been done in this franchise before. It’s certainly a step in the right direction and if they keep this up then maybe sword art online won't be such a meme in future. But a step in the right direction doesn’t equate to a good end-product and I don't have high hopes for season 3, but who knows, this series may shock me once again.

"SAO Ordinal Scale is one of the best comedies ever made, especially when you put on the chicken dance for the fight scenes. Its story is god awful and takes itself wayyy too seriously when it is both laughable and embarrassing. The dialogue ranges from ridiculously mundane info dumps to skin-crawlingly humiliating lines to self-important monologues and discussions to my favorite: downright stupid, over the top, and fucking hilarious matters that are supposed to cause tension. SAO has never had good dialogue, and the dialogue here is only a step up from shit. Everything
is too hamfisted to be interesting and if you pay enough attention, you'll know what's going to happen before the movie's over. The villans are caricatures that swapped places with Kirito in the original SAO and have edgy overly-dramatic lines. There's no tension because the main gimmick of this movie, AR, is too poorly implemented for anything to be enthralling.
It's really nice to look at even if the animation sometimes cuts corners and is kind of jarring; then again, it serves no greater purpose, so I wish I was smoking something while watching this; light shows and pretty colors going boom. Would've made the experience better. But the fight choreography is still only passable to sometimes good, which is a letdown.
This is only a slight step up for me above SAO
If you like SAO, you're going to love this
If you think SAO is mediocre, you'll think this is fine.
and, If you think SAO sucks, you'll think that it's a slight improvement...
Maybe. That's just the impression I got from watching this. It's not good, but if you like SAO, I highly recommend it. And if you hate SAO, I highly recommend watching the fight scenes while listening to the chicken dance song; it's hilarious.
There isn't really much to say about SAO ordinal scale. It suffers from the exact same problems that its predecessors did and it only is marginally better than them.
So then, have a nice day and I wish you the best in your SAO endeavors; I know I'm learning a lot about the don'ts of writing.

"Sword Art Online Movie: Ordinal Scale is not a good movie by any definition of the word ""good""
the story it a train wreak makes no sense if you think about it for more then .10 seconds and you honestly end up siding more with the villain and speaking of villains
characters are the same they grow in no way change in no way the only person i seemed to care about was the villain who might i add it the most obvious villain in the history of anything ever and nobody seems to notice or care for that matter except kirito and spoilers what
he is doing for the more part is fine and he could fix the other thing very quickly so it does not matter in the long run
but i liked the music so i guess thats something",Negatif
"The art is, indisputably, incredible, both visual and sound effects are amazing, which makes you want at the screen more and more, the landscapes and character designs are BEAUTIFUL, but.
God, the plot. It has quite a number of dead ends, misses, just stuff that doesn't add up. The story doesn't make freaking sense. They've tried so hard that they've ended up destroying the whole thing. It's terrible.
I'm not going to talk about the ""humor"" that makes you want to kill yourself instead of laugh.
And then there's the characters. I mean, I knew I couldn't expect much of this series, but they could've made them
a LITTLE deeper? Marvelous male-mary-sue saves the world -again- and his little ""yeah I know how to fight but always SOMEHOW for SOME REASON end up being unable to do it??? woah almost like all that matters about me is that I am pretty enough to be the male hero's love interest"" princess. What a story. So original. Kirito is so freaking perfect that literally every girl around him is in love with him. And guys of course are joking around how hot is Asuna, not in love but, you know, horny. And no other couples or even friendships develop. It's just Super Hero, His Gilfriend, and some birds around for them to play with.
I just, it's all so plain, so boring.  I love the animation, designs music, but that's all there's good to it. Unless you are a 12 years old with chuunibyou. Then you're probably a Kirito wannabe so you'll enjoy this.",Negatif

honestly i had high expectations on this.I like first season it was very good,  second part was sort of average i guess ( i didn't like it much)

"I really wanted to like this because someone I follow was just SO into it. And it made me cry a little, too, so clearly it connected with me on a deep level very few films ever do. But like... I just... don't like it all that much. And not because it made me cry. It gets a higher rating because of that very poignant moment.
This is a truly gorgeously animated film. The fight scenes are wonderfully made. The environments are breathtaking and beautifully detailed, with bright colors and fantastical landscapes and hyper-detailed towns that we really get to explore. The characters are for the
most part really well designed and the humans are pretty diverse in design, too.
The biggest drawback is probably Nezha's regular human form. I just don't... find that appealing. At all. He's not cute. He's not funny. He's honestly kind of just cringe in a way that just grates at the back of your mind the entire film. Maybe if I liked animated features starring very young children more I would have been okay with this, but I just watched ""The Legend of Hei"" and that featured a very young child protagonist who I didn't mind at all, and found rather endearing.
That being said, it is Nezha in this form that made me cry, so it wasn't the sole thing that broke the camel's back for me in this film.
This is probably piggybacking on the overall story, which is ""spoiled child terrorizes townsfolk"". We get backstory that actually there are reasons he's the way he is - and it's not because he's a reincarnated evil spirit - and they are very sympathetic, and if you're watching the scenes where he's terrorizing people, he isn't actually don't that much that's really ""awful"", outside of one instance where he's using a giant wooden mallet to hit people poking their heads out of a carriage, and one instance where he nearly murders a group of children with a boulder. Mostly people just drive themselves into a panic and he gets close to them and they make things worse for themselves through self-injury.
That all being said, I don't really enjoy the story. It's not compelling. Particularly given that a good chunk of the story is just Nezha being a spoiled brat. Sure, he has reasons for how he is, and like I said, his story is sympathetic, but that's not... enough. I guess you have to remember this is a literal 2-3 year old who just wants friends, despite how mature he acts, and people are mean to him. But that's not a thrilling story for me. Yes, children shouldn't be bullied or ostracized, particularly because of their birth. And water is wet.
There are some very good messages at the core of this story. Messages about loving your family, giving people a chance, being a good neighbor, avoiding stereotypes and prejudgment, making time for the people you love, and I think that core message of making your own destiny, of choosing to do what's right, even if no one cares, even if it doesn't change how other people perceive you, even if you don't win accolades, even if you don't get to see that better tomorrow, is a very good message. It's painful, but it's a good message. I think. It's kind of just sad, really. And it's nice to see a story about parents with a cursed kid where the parents don't just kick the bucket before the principal story starts, or they're not incredibly abusive towards said child. And hey, Nezha's mom has lines! Multiple lines! In different scenes! And a story arc! And she fights AND cooks well! That's all a bit out of the ordinary. Usually that character is dead, abusive, or either cooks well or fights, not both at the same time! And dialogue lines on top of it all, jeez! Although it's more of an indictment on other writers/companies than praise for this, since the bar is so low.
I didn't find the fart and dick jokes and general gross humor all that funny, but that's par for the course, and they're not as bad as they often get in similar media. Although they are a bit more disturbing than usual when you consider that one party is a 2-3 year old. I didn't find the alcoholism interesting. The pig jokes... had their moments. Mostly the remote control nose thing. I even generally liked Taiya, but the gross humor frequently featured him, so he was really an eh character overall. His scenes also tended to turn flat really fast, and he does some of the more blah things in the story, so... Eh.
Ao Bing's cute. And apparently smart but completely oblivious to the entire reason for his existence, but okay, he's the info dump character I guess.
The music was pretty good, or at least it was used well. Probably the best two jokes in this are around the music and they're amazing. The other good jokes I can recall are also repeated, but used quite well, and these are all rather minor jokes. But good on that.
Overall I just... find this film kind of okay at best. I wish I liked it more. I wish I wanted to rewatch it, or watch a sequel, or watch a story in the same universe. But I don't.
If you want to watch a Chinese animated film about spirits with good fighting and gorgeous animation, if you can find it, watch ""The Legend of Hei"". That's pretty great. Or if you want something that's got spirits and stars an ostracized child who's working on changing his destiny, watch ""Natsume Yuujincho"". Or if you want a fantasy story about changing your fate with the central theme, watch ""Revolutionary Girl Utena"".",Negatif
"Persona 3 The Movie: No. 1, Spring of Birth was done by AIC A.S.T.A. studio which despite not being a good film I would have preferred if they continued making the films over A-1 Pictures studio. A-1 Pictures had their chance at the Persona franchise with Persona 4: The Golden Animation. Instead of refining Lerche’s earlier anime adaptation, titled Persona 4: The Animation, on the same game A-1 Picture created what is best described as a cash grab. Now they’re in charge of creating a sequel to an average video game movie adaptation. Like with Persona 4: The Golden Animation, A-1 Picture doesn’t seek out
to make improvements, and instead makes sure you know it’s an A-1 Pictures product. What I find funny is during the opening sequence, Makoto says “I don’t know why, but I feel really good” looking up into the sky revealing director Tomohisa Taguchi name. Almost as a way to reassure viewers this sequel is in good hands. It might seem unimportant, but this is the same director behind Persona 4: The Golden Animation. Persona fans, let that sink in as I delve into this bad sequel.
Persona 3 The Movie: #2 Midsummer Knight’s Dream continues the story of Makoto Yuki from the first film leading a group of Persona users to eliminate “The Dark Hour”. This movie opens with a shower scene in a motel room. The film is gracious enough not to provide viewers with a recap of the previous film to pad the running time, but not smart enough to provide context as to why two teenagers are in a motel seemingly about to have sex. I know what happened since I played the game, but even with that said I’m watching a movie not playing it. External knowledge should not be required to understand the first scene of a movie. Once Yukari Takeba finishes showering, putting on a towel while Makoto takes off accessories around his neck. Yukari, and Makoto stare at each other in the middle of the room for a bit before Yukari blushed from embarrassment. The opening scene ends when Yukari slaps Makoto in the face then cue in title card. No scene, can better express what it felt like to see the film. It was, in every metaphorical sense, a slap to the face as a fan of the Person 3 video game.
Now, I want to emphasize this is an A-1 Picture production because it takes 17 minutes before anything significant like story actually appears in the movie. Yes, it takes that long before anything story wise actually starts moving forward in a film that’s around an hour, and forty minutes long. The most important thing relating to story that happens within those first 17 minutes is introducing the passive villains Strega. Everything else is spend on fan service like a scene at a beach involving Junpei Iori describing the swimwear of the female characters as the camera shows them off. Granted, this also happened in the video game, but at least they (the female characters) received some characterization at that point in the video game. Since the last movie didn’t develop the cast into dynamic characters it’ll make you shake your head as this is most of the female characters’ biggest contribution in the film. Another aspect it failed to do within those 17 minutes was introduced anything meaningful to use later on in the film story. After an opening action scene, the characters are next seen on a boat heading to an island, then proceeds for around 10 minutes on the beach on non-story related activity.
Pass those first 17 minutes the film finally provides explanations for questions that should have been answered in the first film. So now you’ll finally get an answer for why Gekkoukan High School transform into Tartarus in “The Dark Hour”, why the Shadows were released into the world, how to possibly eliminate “The Dark Hour”, and how many of the powerful Shadows that appear during a full moon need to be defeated. All of this information would have been useful in the first film! This is basically damage control for the insane decision for characters to withhold information for no good reason. Narratively it leaves the viewers with no exposure to Persona 3 wandering in the dark when information needed to understand how the film world function gets addressed in the sequel. Thankfully, the one good decision from the story was explaining the concept of artificial Personas. Explaining what makes them different from regular Personas, and the consequences they hold. It’s not a focal point in the film, but at least some attention is given to it.
Out of all the material that could have been cut from the film it’s beyond comprehension why the one, and only scene in “The Velvet Room” was left in when all that was said in it was enjoy life to the fullest, and beware of Shadows. This added absolutely nothing of value to the story. The inhabitants of “The Velvet Room” don’t appear again the film besides this one scene. The film was also in need of direction, and main goal to accomplish in the story. There’s a moment in the film where Shinji cooks for a dog while wearing pink cooking apparels. Then, the camera turns around to show an expressionless Aegis staring at Shinji. This causes Shinji to sweat with hip hop music (Mass Destruction by Lotus Juice) playing in the background repeating “Baby, baby, baby”. I just described a pointless moment in the film that the creators of the film approved to animate in the film, even though the first 17 minutes does nothing to move the story forward. Choices like these are the reasons why these Persona 3 films fail to tell a story properly.
While still discussing the first thirty minutes of the film I should get across this sequel ruined one of my favorite scene from the video game. It’s after Yukari sees footage of her father dying (plus a revelation discerning Shadows too), and Makoto goes to the beach at night attempting to make Yukari feel better. I very much like this scene allot in the video game besides being a tender moment gave Yukari more depth as a character. It also ended on a humorous note showing the group strong friendship in hard times. So, when I saw the altered scene play out it was for a different purpose. What should have been a character defining moment for Yukari ends up being the set up to an introductory action scene to show off Aegis capabilities as an Anti-Shadow Suppression Weapon killing a dozen or so shadows. I wouldn’t have mind the action scene if A.) Cell Phones were not shown working in the ""The Dark Hour"" even though the first film establishes technology doesn’t work during “The Dark Hour”, B.) The action scene happens after Yukari sees footage of her father dying which dramatically voids Yukari of a meaningful moment, and finally C.) If in the previous film a single character had no trouble fending off a powerful Shadow in his first time of combat in Tartarus what makes you think I’m going to believe two unarmed characters will be in danger from an encounter where they are surrounded by a dozen weak Shadows.
Okay, with the first 1/3 of the film problems already written about there’s the rest of the film. With newly introduce Cyborg Girl Aegis now part of the main cast the film makes sure to tell audience she has an infatuation with protagonist Makoto Yuki. A love triangle would have benefited the story if done right. Makoto pays more attention towards Aegis in the film than Yukari even though they have known each other longer. Yukari is shown being jealous whenever Aegis says her purpose in life is to be next to Makoto Yuki side. If competently written this would be used to develop Yukari instead of just being used for humor. To add insult to injury Aegis proves to be more powerful, and useful in combat than Yukari who has been fighting Shadows for a far longer time. This romance aspect of the story doesn’t go far beyond Aegis stating she wants to be next to Makoto. Our protagonist shows no interest in either of them, but spends more time with Aegis in the film.
Continuing what was the point of the first film if Makoto didn’t learn to be more open with his emotions! It’s like he reset as a character to learn the same thing in the sequel. However, this film ends on a tragic note which would have made sense for Makoto to be emotionless if that tragic event happened earlier, or if the film was longer to expand on his depress state of mind. It’s headache inducing attempting to figure out why the filmmakers thought this was a good direction to take Makoto character in.
When it comes to characters instead of developing the already large cast this sequel decides to increase its number instead. With the exception of Makoto, all the characters from the previous film are delegated into the background. Including Yukari, and Junpei whom were important in the previous film don’t grow as characters in the sequel. Junpei for instance doesn’t know what he would do after “The Dark Hour” is dealt with, but there’s no exploration on it. Other characters who also pondered this same question in one scene. Beside Makoto Yuki, everyone else’s thoughts on the question feel unimportant. A negative that detracts from the whole group dynamic when its tries to get across SEES is made up of close friends. Any character that was in the sideline in the first film don’t receive better treatment except for Akihiko who receives some characterization. Unlike the first film where the climax allowed him to contribute to the story. In this entry, Akihiko ends up short as his connection with Shinjiro has to be rushed, nor is the idea that they (Shinjiro and Akihiko) are good friends is done convincingly.
A total of seven characters get added to the cast. One of them is Ken Amada who turns out the best developed of the new characters. He has a simple backstory that eventually turns into a sub-plot of revenge. This leads to Ken being more developed as a character since the reasons behind his negative feelings on living are addressed. Koromaru is a dog that can use a Persona who has no backstory to him. Ken says a single line that Koromaru got left behind, but that could mean anything from an owner who forgot his dog to a street dog with no owner. A single line won’t make me care Koromaru, even if he’s a cute dog who can use a Cerberus like Persona. Finally, there is Shinjiro Aragaki who joins SEES fifty minute into the film. Anybody who has played the game (minus maxing out Shinjiro social link in Persona 3 Portable female route) knows Shinjiro fate in the story. His late addition to SEES makes Shinjiro character be rushed, and his impact on the story overall weak. Without much time spend with him, along with other characters, there’s no reason to be invested in their story. He’s also a plot convenience in the film when he goes to the rescue of SEES.
If you complained about Makoto Yuki being overpowered in the first film; this film offers a solution by providing another overpowered character. This time in the form of Aegis who also just as powerful as Makoto. In this film, Aegis is responsible for doing most of the fighting while Makoto is given a handicapped depending on the context. The climatic fight in particular has Makoto pondering his purpose after eliminating “The Dark Hour” for most it. While on the climax, it does a disservice to Junpei, and Yukari characters as they get beaten quickly showing they had not grown stronger since the first film. As a character, Aegis is simply a robot that doesn’t blend well with other human with how she acts. Unfortunately, she doesn’t learn, or wants to seek out what it means to be human in the film. Though, given the archetype of Aegis it’s bound to happen. Her defining trait in this film is being overpowered, and being attached to Makoto Yuki allot.

Lastly for the characters there are the members of Strega. A group that only has one character who has anything to do in the story. His name is Takaya Sakaki who states his intentions, and make the heroes ponder the questions of their purpose without “The Dark Hour”. Takaya is only in this film to kill off a certain character whose death has not much impact because that specific character short screen time. The other members of Strega don’t do much beside exist. Finally, there’s the character of Pharos who also has little to do in the film. Much like the one scene in “The Velvet Room”, Pharos appearance could have been cut out since he basically states the obvious of something bad is about to happen.
A-1 Pictures is in charge with the production, and thankfully at least that is carried over from previous film. A-1 Pictures doesn’t improve on the animation aspect, but there is not a decrease in quality either from film to film. There’s more variety in the settings. The majority of the movie takes place at night time with the presence of heavy shadows. Like in the previous film, it’s reliance on lighting to create an eerie atmosphere. When in “The Dark Hour” blacks into dark greens and the blues into reds. This carries in the film insistent on color saturation be it making day scenes intensely bright, or making night scenes really dark. Almost as if it’s unable to trust viewers with the time of day a scene takes place in. Particle effects are amped up in the battles from the previous film as members in SEES equals to more Persona on screen using magic attack, or the characters killing shadows. When Aegis is killing a group of Shadows in her first action scene the animation is fluid as she quickly moves around the environment, the framing of shot making it clear to see what’s going on, and the effects to add to the impact of an attack be it heavy flames, or bullet piercing. There is some bad 3D animation during a major action scene that doesn’t blend with 2D animation in the middle of the film. Besides this, the 3D in the film is not jarringly noticeable through its duration.
Voice acting is satisfactory once again. With too many characters, and unequal screen time the majority of the main voice cast from the first film get sideline without being offered single a scene to display their talent. Giving more than half of its voice talent the equivalent of thankless roles. New addition Kazuya Nakai who plays Shinjirou Aragaki gets the most ranged in a rushed amount of time. His performance is noteworthy as despite the speed his character changes tone Kazyua Nakai always sound natural. He makes the swift change in his character easier to accept. Megumi Ogata plays Ken Amada has a steadier change in her performance. Going from uncertain scare kid, too optimistic, to gloomy is handle well through her performance. I might not like the character Ken Amada, but she makes the character convincing. Then there’s Maaya Sakamoto who plays Aegis who has plenty of screen time. Unfortunately, her character is a cyborg trying to learn emotion archetype. However, since Aegis hasn’t gotten philosophical of what it means to be human Maaya Sakamoto is monotone for the whole film. It goes with the character in this instance, but it ends up being a forgettable performance. Sakamoto monotone delivery of her lines does not provide hint of a complex character making Aegis seem hollow than she might actually be.
What really bothers me the most about the performances is voice actor Akira Ishida doesn’t get to expand on his character Makoto Yuki. So he once again has to play the same emotionless, broken leading character from the first film. Ishida is not allowed to be more emotional, more expressive in his portrayal of Makoto Yuki. This film does the biggest disservice to him since by not allowing Akira Ishida to gradually transition his emotionless character to a more expressive one. The film rejects Akira Ishida the opportunity to expand Makoto Yuki beyond what was presented in the first film. It feels like a retread of his performance from the first film. While his retread performance is not bad it doesn’t quite the same effect the second time around.
Persona 3 The Movie: #2 Midsummer Knight’s Dream is a bad film continuing being inaccessible for newcomers, and infuriating for Persona 3 fans for not making the appropriate changes for the material to function as a movie. None of the character are developed enough to care about, there’s no tension because of two overpowered characters, a large cast most of whom don’t contribute to the story, and is predictably boring for anyone who played Persona 3 as it does nothing to throw fans off guard. It looks, and sounds like Persona 3, but by the time the credits roll it won’t be the same emotional roller coaster the video game was.",Negatif
"Persona 3 the Movie 2: Midsummer Knight's Dream is the sequel to Spring of Rebirth. The problem is that it is not exactly clear when the movie takes place other than that it hints that it is something like the summer. The movie immediately begins in the middle of the Lovers' Shadow on a full moon with no context for how they got there. It immediately cuts to a beach episode before getting serious again. They flash some scenes of minor characters and social links, but unless you played the game, you would have no idea who they are. While there seems to be a
story between the past relationship of two characters, it is split up so far apart and not emphasized before it reaches the climax and you actually figure out the significance of the event. It felt like there was a lack of direction and they chose to just adapt what they felt would be popular with the fans rather than trying to make a coherent story.
Like its predecessors, the art and the sound are great. The animation is excellent and makes great use of CGI to show how the Persona are foreign. The impressive shadow and lighting effects make their return and continues to contribute to the overall feeling of the story. There are a few scenes where the lighting does seem a little off because one character appears with shadows and then suddenly, another character in the same conversation does not. The sounds and music of the game make their return in high quality.
The poor story ultimately hurts the character development and the overall enjoyment of the movie. While the first movie spent some time to develop the characters, Midsummer Knight's Dream felt like it constantly shifted between action scenes and suspense scenes, skipping large chunks of the story just so it could follow this formula. The few scenes that do not follow this do little to contribute further to the characters. This becomes an even bigger problem in the third movie, Falling Down, where one of the things they kind of glossed over becomes important towards the climax of the that movie. This movie felt like a movie that could only be enjoyed by people who had already played the game because then you could at least do things like fill in the missing information yourself. But if you are experiencing Persona 3 for the first time, all this does is leave you confused.",Negatif
"It is finally over.
""Runway de Waratte"", the most overrated and boring show of the season.
This anime is about a girl, who wants to become a top model, and a boy, who wants to be a fashion designer. 2 boring and useless topics in my opinion. But I gave a chance to this anime. That wasn't worth. Every episode 3/4 characters start to cry for things like ""My dress is not good"" or ""That person told me I'm not good"". It annoys. Fortunately, the plot was mainly about the boy, and not the girl, that is like a wet cardboard.
The art. My god. I don't like
the drawing style, but hey, that's my opinion (even if sometimes the drawings look very bad, especially come clothes). But the animations... looks like they haven't spent a single yen for the animations. Sometimes, the pattern on the clothing will retain the same orientation regardless of the positioning of the character. This looks bad, and that's an anime about clothing. Come on, that looks like they put zero effort in this show.
The OP was pretty decent, the ED not. The dubs were not that bad anyway.
The characters were the thing that I really hated about Runway de Waratte. They all looks very selfish and infamous, except for the MC. Even the girl. I mean, how can you say ""I want to become a top model"" without being selfish? All others looks like wet cardboards, with poor personality.
Don't watch this anime. It's not entertaining. I want my time back. I onestly hope there won't be a 2nd season.",Negatif
"I regret watching this series. I realised about halfway through how poor it was, but saw it through, wanting the satisfaction of the ending. The ending was not worth persevering for.
The worst aspect of the show was probably the relentless melodrama. Characters hardly ever seemed to stop shouting and crying. Every time someone said something mean to a character, you'd get the dramatic *GASP*, their eyes widening, their body freezing, as if the universe were crashing down around them. When they felt like being especially extra, they'd even drop to their knees. After a while it just became comical and I found myself laughing during
what were supposed to be emotional scenes, because it was just so ridiculously over the top.
The characters generally weren't terrible, I've come across worse. I liked Chiyuki's toughness and bluntness. But Ikuto... I'm the last person to have a problem with soft, gentle boys, but Ikuto was obnoxiously good. So polite, so pure, so self-sacrificing... so boring.
The art and music were below average. I don't quite understand why you would take on an anime whose primary theme is fashion when you don't have the budget to animate at least the clothes beautifully. The final fashion show, the highlight you wait all series for, is incredibly disappointing, and really leaves you feeling that you wasted your time.",Negatif
"This show is enjoyable, but somewhat plain. Throughout every twist and turn, the audience this is aimed at is pretty clear. This is a show for kids. It's about hard work and never giving up, which is a great message. Even so, if you want something that is truly meaningful and engaging, I'd say watch something else. This show is a shounen at it's core, despite being about fashion. The themes are right on the nose, the characters are likable but definitely plain. All I can say is that I was never surprised, impressed, or engaged with this show. It's not a bad show, just
definitely not meant for me. Definitely give it a go if you want something inspiring and simple. Even so, I give it a somewhat lower rating because I didn't find it worth my time at all. Not to mention that there's not much to remember this series by other than it's interesting insight into the fashion industry (most likely not the most realistic).",Negatif
"Everyone's favorite wholesome  playboy Tanjiro takes break from seducing demon slayer gals  to charming fashion  designers and models by providing emotional support and encouragement then they really need it . Say what you want about him but he sure knows his way around women.
Jokes aside Smile down the runway is about talented but poor designer and a short model and their journey of becoming successful in their careers. Show does a good job of portraying its characters' desires , ambitions , regrets and  accomplishments while presented with pretty  animation and designs with some sprinkles of comedy. So why do i
think this show is only worth 6?
Well while whatever show does, it doesn't do it poorly , I don't thing it does anything exceptionally well either . Whole  'Poor but talented protagonist who has ill family member who has been in hospital for long time' is so common and even overused, there could be a template  where you only need to fill in character names and rest of story is written for you. So it would be more of surprising  if show messed up such refined formula. What this means, all in all story is not really interesting. If you are some one who is new to anime it might not be that big of an issue but for me, I knew how whole show would turn up out early as episode 3. It could say subverted my expectations of what it was going to be but it never does, overall predictability of the plot ruins any sense of tension or excitement a viewer might have.
Regarding animation its more or less the same. Its clothes and  characters are drawn well and you have some money shots, but  I was never taken away or impressed by it I can't really recall any scenes if you were to ask me to and i watched this was 2 days ago. It is bit unfair to criticize  the animation, it never hampered the show and it pulled  its weight, but then overall story is not interesting enough to justify watching the show, you try to find other aspects of show which are worth watching the show for but unfortunately animation isn't one of them.
Overall music was pretty good I did find Opening and ending songs fun to listen to and in between tracks which accompany the show do a good job setting the mood and conveying  the emotions characters are experiencing.
On final note Run down the run way  has alot of same vibes as Welcome to the Ballroom but what ballroom did well but this show failed to do  was get me interested into a subject.  I won't pretend after watching  Wellcome to the Ballroom I went started watching ballroom competitions but	nether the less the show managed to convey rare and bit unusual topic in a interesting and entertaining way so that even some one like me, who never had any interest in ballroom dances, enjoyed it.
Meanwhile Smile down the runway failed to awoke same type of interests in modeling, clothes  designing and  creating. Maybe if it focused on those topics more intricately by closely following  design process or  was more informative and technical with sewing and different techniques associated with it, but as it is whole fashion and modeling seemed more like a surface level reskin to make it look like show was unique and interesting then in reality it was very cliche story.
As a summary I fail to see why I would recommend this show to anyone, it doesn't do anything interesting with topic its covering  nor does anything new with 'poor guy big dream' trope. At one point I was thinking maybe it is aimed at female demographic but problem with that is that, show focuses very little on heroine compared to protagonists, not to mention most fan service features the heroine; its pretty clear who show tries to appeal to then it has a shot of Chiyuki doing a split in pink underwear while wearing red stiletto heels.",Negatif

See some of the synopses out there that promise to make me interested
with this anime but anime what is this, destroyed once. Indeed the first episode of the submission of this anime is already good, the purpose of the model and the requirements to enter the world of models is already delivered with the well and make me understand a little how hard the world of modeling, so I thought after watching the first episode but after watching further, I wonder why it's so boring. They cut the scene did not hesitate and time scene seriously even seem bland, but the story is good. Do not well in the same mind if the anime model-the model is not great but the focus to the MC, who is a genius but still blunt and heroine of his disabilities make as a model is really heavy for chasing ideals.
In the adaptation of the manga, I thought this would be a great spectacle because the studio does not need to think at length about the picture to the anime, usually adapt the anime derived from light novel which means they still have to think how to unite a word-the word becomes the object of the video, as for the manga they save thinking initially in the form of drawings and writings must now be converted into video objects. Graphic design is good the effect of the light is very fitting nothing too shining, or otherwise. The staging of the design of the model and the clothes worn model is very unique and nice, they are very totality in drawing a design of clothes.
The opening theme is very nice I very like when the singer says ""watashi wo waraitobashita kage wo"" ahhh.... I think this must be the ""Runway de Waratte"" come on, this is about signature of many anime. Somehow, I'm not familiar with voice actors (Seiyuu) Natsuki Hanae, last season Kimetsu no Yaiba to be in the spotlight and ""Natsuki Hanae"" is becoming increasingly famous, I also really like when they say ""Don't Give up"" somehow that voice is always ringing in my head. For this part I really like and they are the totality of about this, I think this section can cover the part of the story that I think the hiatus.
Excess and Deficiency (May contain some spoilers)
I think I'm very fond of parts of the sound compared to the story, although the story is not that bad but a lot of some scenes which I think is bland in fact I think such a scene should be suspenseful. In addition to it I think the advantages possessed by this anime is a good quality video, I can't talk much about this, I think you should watch some video trailer and judge whether the quality of the video is good or not.
I'm very fond of this spectacle, it can't be denied of the many anime that aired this season may this be a selah one of the best. It's a shame this only got adaptation as many as 12 episodes only. Overall this anime deserves to be watched but also not that good, for the size of the anime season one maybe this can touch the value of 8 from me.",Negatif
"Overall, this one is fine.
A LITTLE SPOILER
The first 3 episodes is really-really compelling that I can say this is one of series with best first episodes. I can't breath properly and the episode's intensity really make my heart thumping, excited, and nervous at the same time. The first three episodes told the sudden upside-down world of Ikuto's life from ordinary high-school boy to a backstage fashion-designer (with Chiyuki as the model) for Tokyo Fashion Week to replace other designer that couldn't attend the event. You can grasp a bit the intensity of fashion industry just by seeing this appealing episodes, especially the chaos in
the backstage where everything happens in insanly-fast pace.
After that, I don't really remember what happened because, suddenly, the remaining episode of the series become really bland and I feel no excitement at all. There are some tearjerking episodes but I don't remember it well anyway.
At the end, if you have a bit curiousity about how fashion industry work, this series is good to go.",Negatif
"Smile Down the Runway was going to do for the fashion world what Food Wars did for the culinary world. Now maybe that's a rather monumental assessment of this show, but for the first few episodes I honestly felt that it could. This show had the ingredients to be not only a good show this season, but a great show for this year. Notice how i'm using past tense? Don't worry when you watch this show yourself you'll understand why.
As per usual lets talk about the positives of this show. This is a beautiful show. That's just plain and simple. The moments in the
show that require it to be jaw dropping gorgeous are just that, jaw dropping gorgeous. On top of that this show also takes a page from the shounen hand book and makes the majority of the pacing flow in a way that you never feel bored. Many shounen shows try to keep this style of pacing (Think about the very first season of My Hero Acadamia as an example of this style of pacing done right.) but fall flat with the amount of episodes being to much for the amount of story. This show keeps itself to 12 episodes and not a single episode is spent on things that don't become plot important. Every moment and character become important, and honesty I commend the show for being able to pull that off.
The biggest issues with this show however fall into two categories. The story itself and the last 3 episodes. I'll start with the story. If you take a look at the poster art or the trailer for this show you'd probably think that this show is about this short girl named Chiyuki trying to become a HYPEMODEL (watch the first episode and you'll get the joke) and the trials and tribulations she and her friend Ikuto, who's trying to become a fashion designer, face as they get into the fashion world. If this is what you thought then congratulations you've been suckered. Chiyuki is not the main character of this show. Ikuto is. So I hope you're as excited about the trials of building clothes because that's what you get from a good 85% of this show. That's not to say the story is bad at all. I'm just saying for what the show sold itself to be it 180s and becomes something it wasn't. If this doesn't bother you then that's ok, but it's worth knowing before going into this show expecting what the show looks like it'll be. As for my second issue with the last 3 episodes I'll keep it with no spoilers. Episodes 10 and 11 are the climax of the show and you can tell by the amount of time put into them. Episode 12 feels rushed, and with one of the major character conflict having to be resolved in episode 12 you can tell by how fast they go through it that they didn't really care about that conflict. It leaves you feeling unsatisfied.
At the begin of this review I said Smile Down the Runway was going to do for the fashion world what Food Wars did for the culinary world. Sadly, it won't. Food Wars understood that you need to treat every character and plot as if it was a seasoning to a dish, and make them all work together without overtaking the others. Smile Down the Runway doesn't do this and because of that what could have been a ""wow you remember that great show from a few seasons ago"" is actually a ""you know that show was pretty good this season"". This show is worth watching and enjoying but at the end of the day it's not worth remembering.",Negatif
"If only Sara were here, she would have written an awesome review for the series. She would have probably written it in French as well. It's not that writing anime reviews is a part of Miss Minchin's seminary curriculum, it's just about me, a barely literate otaku boy, even a hundred years later, still having little chance to do it better.
`Princess Sara' is based on a novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, `A Little Princess' (1905), with quite a history of rewrites and adaptations, and this particular anime belongs to a bigger project known as `World Masterpiece Theater', which gathers adaptations of classical western books and
stories. I am yet to see other adaptations or other titles of the project (though you might have accidentally seen some already), and i feel as if there is a good reason for me to doubt that other adaptations of Princess Sara would be any better, for what i have just seen actually is, one way or another, a masterpiece.
The original book is actually quite short. You can easily find it and read it along with watching. The anime, on the contrary, was made dramatic and grand. It wasn't simply stretched to fill a year of airing. I must admit these guys had really felt it through and transformed it into something bigger, unfolding the story step by step to be sure each and every thought and feeling reaches you.
That said, i cannot say i instantly fell in love with these series; i only decided to put the top mark for it after around episode 36. By that time the story is mostly over, but it is the way they presented it that fascinates.
Would an story like that appeal to a modern viewer? Sure it will. I'm actually quite sure that most of us will one day meet a person like Miss Minchin as their superior, and would have to choose if they would behave like Lavinia or like Lottie. Or maybe even like Becky. And i can only hope you won't ever have to behave like Sara :) People haven't changed a bit. Maybe just scales are different, society pushes in a bit different direction, maybe the story exaggerates a little bit, but people making the world go around are still the same.
Note how this is one of those works where relatively little is said in words. No, it's not your typical `tenshi no tamago', of course, but they still often avoid speaking for like five minutes in the beginning of an episode, depicting a quiet morning when you don't really want to involve yourself in making noise yet. A lot is being said by directly showing it, in such a way that a thousand words won't really show it all. And that is where art and sound get a chance to really show themselves.
First, you have *these eyes*. Whether our characters look out of the window,  stare at each other, or simply do whatever they need to do, their eyes say a lot. And Sara's look has a special role. As Lavinia, the one most affected by it, accidentally grasps the essence and mentions what was probably intended to be the author's lines, which happens to her from time to time, ""Sara has been decreased to that little, yet she still behaves as if she's noble"". Just looking at her eyes, you see that Sara never really looses her face through out the story. She effectively completes her ""shoujo quest"" of ""never letting anybody know how you feel, even if you're about to die"" (cf. Fruits Basket, for example), and her eyes always expose her attitude as cleanly as possible. I'm not really crazy about megapixels in anime artwork, but these eyes pretty much outweigh the shortcomings of old school graphics for me.
Then there's seiyuu work. Shimamoto Sumi, whom you might remember starring in Nausicaa a year before, is really doing epic great here, from the simple ""ah~"" sound opening the talk in most episodes, and ""ma~, Becky ..."" whenever something funny (or not really, at all, funny) happens, to the ultra-polite and forever-genki cheerful optimistic ""please watch the next episode"" annoncement, it leaves an aftersound straight in your brain, and suits her character ... perfectly. Opening and ending themes are also very noble; though possibly background music could have been made a bit gentler.
Time to wrap up, so let me put it straight: This is not your typical anime. There's nothing wrong if you don't watch it, or drop in the middle, or something like that. But it is also great if, alongside with being a naruto fanboy or a precure fangirl, or vice versa, or whatever, you also enjoy *that* sort of stuff together with me, as i'm enjoying modern stuff most of the time as well. It may also appeal directly to those who enjoy shoujo stories in general, or looking for pain and suffering like urobuchi's, or even those magical doll lovers everywhere. And there's still much more in it.
Last but not least, not sure if this anime is translated to your native language, but full English subs are there waiting for you to watch. I can't help saying thanks to the guys who kept these around till today. Miss Minchin would probably not approve them. She'll ask something like ""How can they do such an outrageous thing?"", seeing these guys helping out each other, if you know what i mean :)",Negatif
"This anime is basically the slowest something could be in the first place, and the plot after the first 10 episodes of everyone jizzing over the mc is her being tortured after that. The plot is mostly the other workers telling them (the 2 poor tortured girls) to work hard as those other workers slack off and large amounts of time being spent for the other characters to say yes to working harder even though they were already working hard, or the headmistress making some unreasonably bitchy complaint accusing someone of doing something they did not do that the headmistress knows that other person did
not do, followed by a large amount of time being spent for the character to say yes and ""accept"" blame. Seriously that is the entire core plot, and it is so slow and takes so much time (if you have a brain in your head but still decide to watch this based on the relatively high rating, please keep that finger on the fast forward button).
But what makes this quite simply the worst something could be is when MCmctorturedgirl is EXCITED to see the girl who spent the entire anime torturing her the most (ep 33?) and then calls her, and not just to not get into trouble, her fucking friend (ep 34?). Like I get that the point was to make her a messiah figure but this was the biggest, most poorly written stretch of all time.
(the music is great when not being badly repeated, usually is badly, relentlessly repeated)",Negatif
"Absolutely awful.  Let me start off first by saying that I've read the book several times and watched several of the other more popular versions.  They are some of my favorites.  There is so much wrong with this adaptation that I could go on and on but I'll keep it short.  The characters are characterized as weak and stupid.  Sara herself is basically purity sue.  She is perfect and all the others either lover or hate her.  Aside from that, she is an incredibly passive version of her book self.  She spends much of the series crying,
given a limited amount of dialogue which consists of mostly ""Yes, Headmistress.""  The other characters always come to her rescue.  The whole point of the book was how she overcame her struggles through her incredible imagination, which we see very little of in this version.
The villians in this all don't seem to have lives.  They are never shown doing any work despite living in a huge establishment with a skeletal staff where there would be a TON of work to do. They only seem to exist to make Sara's life miserable.  Miss Minchin was a credible, shrewd villain in the book.  She hated Sara but knew that she could be quite useful as an instructress as well as a help in the kitchen, a maid and errand girl, after she loses all her fortunes. This Minchin is incredibly shallow.  Furthermore she is given a five minute Freudian Excuse for her behavior during a later episode.  And at the end we're supposed to just forgive her nasty behavior for 20+ episodes because of it.
Lavinia was barely a side character who occasionally made trouble for Sara, not the front and center bully like she is in this.  She also wasn't American in the book.  None of the cast was.
There's also a potential love interest whose existence throws in a major plot hole to the whole plot.
The animation is weak even for 1980's standards. The characters make strange expressions and you can't tell what they're feeling half the time.  It's also incredibly redundant.  I don't need to see Sara ironing and washing dishes for eons in each episode before the head housemaid comes in and screams at her.
Please skip this and watch any of the other versions. If you're a diehard fan, then watch it, but don't expect much.  The 1986 version with Amelia Shankley is the closest version to the book imo and way better than this version which, I don't think even tried.",Negatif
"You can cut this anime series down to 30 episodes (mostly from the middle of the series) and STILL display enough of Sara's suffering to make a point - that it's a hard-knock life, for .... uh, ahem...that song does stick doesn't it?
It's dragged out way too long and I ended up skipping through part of several episodes just to get to the conclusion.
It started out as something interesting, but became something rather painful and aggravating to watch. The balance is off. Extremely cold-hearted, evil people all congregated under one building and supportive characters that lacked voice and power to make much of a
difference during most of the anime. The ending is not satisfying. I understand the important message where ""we can all get along"" but there's a point where you draw the line to certain people.
It's a decently made anime, but it has too many 'stressful' scenes to watch. I didn't enjoy this anime. The anime itself is a 6.5, but I got to give it a 4, it was more pain then pleasure.",Negatif
"Pokemon has long been a part of my childhood. It inspired me in so many ways and created so many unforgettable memories. That being said, Gotcha! was one of those works that I just don't get. Sure, some of its aspects were absolutely breathtaking, but on the other hand, so much of the actual music video was just a disappointment. Maybe I put too many expectations when I watched this, but at the end of the day, although I enjoyed it, I can't say that this rekindled my nostalgia for pokemon in any way.
Story: 4
This is honestly already a high rating for this animation. There
really wasn't any real story that was told, but it did show glimpses into some of the most memorable moments throughout each of the pokemon games. At the end of the day, this section is pretty bare-bones and honestly boring and disappointing.
Art: 10
Oh god, this was beautifully made. The animation was some of the best I've seen in a while, and watching the fluent depictions of each of the fights was magical. The retro effects added so much aesthetics to this piece of art, and honestly, it made this music video so worth it for me. It helps me forget about the non-existent story or anything else that I found less than satisfactory about this work.
Sound: 5
Hot take, but I don't really like the song. I'm not really familiar with the artist behind it either, but at the end of the day, the song was just extremely generic. Considering that this was a music video, I was heavily expecting something outstanding in the music department but was left disappointed by what I've received. However, the music does fit the ideas that were shown in the video, so at least the music works. It just doesn't do anything exciting.
Character: 9
What else do I say about this? Some of my favourite characters from video games compiled into a music video is definitely something I've been wanting for a while. Sure, I may be blinded by nostalgia for this part, but at the end of the day, these are definitely were definitely a welcomed return.
Enjoyment: 6
I was really torn between the fantastic animation and characters, and the subpar storyline and sound design. At the end of the day, I found it good, but nothing extraordinary.
Overall: 6
As stated in my enjoyment category, I found this work good, but it was held back extremely by the song and story. However, it is a well-deserved music video that expresses the nostalgic values behind the decades of memories created by pokemon for millions upon millions of people.",Negatif
"It flashes way too much to understand anything. There is no plot. I was curious, why this is so high in rankings and... pokemon nostalgia, they say?
The only thing that deserves high score there is art. Technically, it's pretty nice done. If you're into art, then you will like this video.
Sound is ok, but nothing outstanding there
I like AMV videos in general, collected a fair bunch of them, but this one, while being official, is not on the bright side. Again: it flashes too much, and it shows nothing particulary interesting. People faces, that dash around for like 0.5 second, aren't very appealing (i mean,
i even know some of them, but what is so cool aboout it?
All in all, it has zero sense, and it's impossible for me to enjoy art when it constantly flashes. But art itself is beautiful, so its probably worth 2 minutes of your life
(and if you are a pokefan, then it is a must watch, this is pretty obvious)",Negatif
"Four episodes in and the story is already not making any sense, and yes, I have watched Alicization and even that is better compared to what we've gotten in the past 4 episodes of this, this is slated to be 12 episodes? Well that's a surprise, but a good one because it's not faring well so far.
The story is summarized by bad guy tries to take Alice cause she's the building blocks of the entire VR world they are in apparently. Though it all falls apart now that we know that the bad guy is absolutely insane. Think of all previous SAO baddies up till
now. This current one is about 5x that and it's just the same sex fiend bad guy that the previous ones where. Only he wants to kill you at the same time for his high.
So, that's the story and characters so far, as Kirito and Alice haven't had much of an roll so far, and Asuna remains on the sidelines. It amazes me to think SAO has gone on for this long with the same generic bad guy at the end of each season. And when so many plot holes and deus ex moments fill it.
Art is probably the best thing about this anime, and sound a close second, it can still get me pumped at the right moments, but those moments are tiresome when the rest isn't all that good to watch which is why I'm questioning myself watching it.
Overall enjoyment is null. There is none, but it passes the time and there are still worse things to watch that wouldn't get me as frustrated as something that could be good would. I do not suggest watching this.",Negatif
"""SAO is finally a good show"" - general audiences after this season
So far SAO is a bad series not that no one could enjoy it, its just badly written. I still somewhat enjoyed it for its silly moments and had my fair share of fun watching it. Sword Art Online Alicization - War of Underworld tho is by many people  regarded as the Season were SAO finally gets good. Well i disagree a whole lot with that statement and here is why.
Its time to beat a dead horse i guess.
I will maybe write some things some say are spoilers so here is
a warning.
This Season trys some new things disregarding its all to familiar protagonist Kirito and choosing Alice as its new one. While i would give the author credit for at least trying he ultimately made many of the same mistakes and that is the reason why he in my eyes failed at truly changing the series for the better.
At the end of the last Season the big bad Pontifex was defeated and Kirito fell in some kind of coma. Now the ""dark territory"" is set to attack and the Integrity Knights are trying to build up some kind of defense against them.
Alice is our new main character and she has some real writing issues in my humble opinion.She makes some really dumb decisions to protect Kirito wich she does above all else, after seeing some dudes arguing to kill Kirito cause he killed their god she decides to leave. Instead of staying by the side of the people that 1. have influence and 2. know about Kirito and the bad things the Pontifex did she decides to go back to her home city. Why not ask some other Integrity knights to help her hide why go alone? This is just and example of how stupid and impulsive it gets.
Furthermore her biggest character trait is her love for Kirito, i know she questions some things after being treated like trash but this is never explored in any way. The reason for almost everything she does is that she wants to protect him, wich can be fine in a Adventure type setting but not if the reason she is the main character is that the series wants to distance itself from Kirito. Thus Kirito seems yet again as the main reason for almost everything a big chunk of the cast does anything.
Every other cast member is not really noteworthy tbh.
The new big bad that wants to take Alice Fluctlight comes from the outside world. He gets access to the emperor ""account"" of the dark territory, he does that in a spectacular easy way given that project Alicization is supposed to be the next new still steamy way of war. The amount of security is basically non existent. His and the character of his bro are both complete garbage they are the typical bad guys with no development or even exposition to why they do the things they do in the way they do it. I mean there is literally nothing. We get 2 names and a profit orientated goal....thats it. In the Underworld the worldbuilding gets expanded in a horrendous way, we get a big introduction of maybe all the races that live there. This introduction is the typical ""giv em some text for the minimum of information"", i mean come the fuck on thats so god damn lazy. All the races we got have the most generic underdeveloped leaders ever, we again get name and 1 over exaggerated personality trait. Ok....1 of them that gets some more spotlight in the later episodes but he never had any kind of character arc he just snapped and in the span of some minutes changes sides.
On the side of the Human empire we have some more spotlight on the characters but again everything feels lazy and rushed. Every Integrity Knight either is a tool for info dumping us, in the last episode some characters where in a pickle and one of the Integrity Knights appeared out of nowhere and gave them the solution that we as a watcher couldnt answer because we never got the amount of worldbuilding required to answer that question. As for the Integrity Knights themselves we got every typical character present the quiet but strong one, the anxious but overcoming it one, the charismatic leader one, the 2 lolis, the overly annoying apprentice one. Every character gets the development that is to be expected after seeing them for the first time most of them overcome their issues in the most predictable and anti climactic way possible.
We also got some characters from the first season that return now and that in probably the most fun but ultimately worst episode of SAO, i am of course talking about episode 5 and its only purpose to show Kiritos Harem wich he build throughout the first Season. Each and every Girl he helped in some kind of way comes to cry at his chair and thats 99% of the episode.
Almost every scene that is not in the Underworld is there to give explanation about the absurd story, its just characterless characters reading some scientific stuff that explains ""everything"". Present the information in a way anyone could care about and it maybe be decent. But this is for sure not the way my lovely A1 team.
One last little point about the story is that this is supposed to be a war right? I highly doubt that there is only one war front each when the only 2 known empires are at war. The tactics are also questionable if the big daddy emperor is such a great allmighty being why not directly fight then? Why not surround the enemy if you are so much stronger? Why not investigate on the Integrity Knights powers and then search for a solution against those powers?
Thats about all my really major issues, of course there are some more things on the terrible worldbuilding etc. But that would be a waste of time since it should be clear that the Underworld is not the best explored world there is.
The Sound is good but nothing groundbreaking,  that is to be expected since SAO is A1s baby and they probably spent a lot of god damn money on it. The overall soundtrack is also not bad but also nothing outstanding, Lisa did the OP if ya like her voice you'll probably enjoy it. The animation/art section is the one that ones again shows how god damn lazy this show is, the overall animation feels smooth most of the time but oh my lord jesus fucking chris EVERY and i mean EVERY soldier from every army looks 100% the same, are they clones mhhhhhh i highly doubt it. The shot composition is as basic and generic as it gets, not a single shot tells us anything about the world or characters, the everything thats not animated in the foreground is done in a lazy (copy and paste soldiers) and generic way that shows that the show once again goes full ""lets make our animation look good on a superficial way but with 0 depth or thought put into it"".
In the end this Season changes little about the series be it for worse or for better it still is somewhat entertaining and good to laugh at.....maybe not as entertaining as the last Season since edge lord Kirito is cosplaying the sleeping beauty.If you enjoy and legitimately think its good....you do you i guess. Go hate or debate all you want and maybe just maybe we can agree to disagree.",Negatif
"When I watch an SAO series, I usually try not to expect much from it. When you have SAO, I usually just watch it for the world-building and the interesting concepts. Things like characters or story, I try to pass on some of the less glaring confusing plotholes.
For the good things about the show. I find it very interesting the concepts with the fluctlight and the VR dive technology. I think most of us wouldn't mind a summer vacation there, minus all the anime dangers. Alice is also a more decent character, with her origin and care for Kirito, you have to appreciate her.
However,
I can't say much more good about it; Sword Art Online: Alicization War of Underworld is just a mess. To begin with, the viewer is confused about what in the world is happening in the outside world. The pacing is a little awkward, while most of the time we are shown the VR world, they show is rushed detail the conflict going on at the base with the VR tech is at. Which I have to add, usually most people don't care about the outside world if you have a focus story-wise on the VR one. Assassins Creed tried it, and look at how everyone reacted with Desmond. Anyway, we know there is an attack on the base by some bad guys, and we are confused about who they are affiliated with, which brings me to the next point.
One of the reasons why some thought to come back to watch the SAO series with Alicization is that those common things associated with SAO were different. Kirito is not exactly overpowered, especially currently, but that we know will change. Also, there is a philosophical debate about the AI people being actual humans or not.
Sadly it seems to again be falling into the standard ""SAO tropes."" SAO has always had a problem with villains, and the one introduced this season is just as creepy and has he exact face as all the other past minor or major villains of SAO. And I guess nowadays, having a basic boring villain would be actually refreshing? Well, it normally would be okay, except SAO has a tendency to well... make the villains very disturbing and show some really unnecessary graphic scenes in order to tell you the villain is ""bad"". It is a turn off to a lot of people, and really confusing with the more light-hearted tone of the story.
I will probably finish watching this because I hate to leave a series I've so heavily invested into unfinished. But I think after this last episode I need a short break from it this next week.",Negatif
"Ok, so that's SAO too annoying when were gonna have to wait for the next sequel:
So:
Story:
Pros: The same plot and it involve where he 1st sequel end and as sual it involves them characters going back in to the VMMOPG world only this time the guy was push into the sidelines as a cripple and it's them girls who does the ass kicking.
Cons: The same plot where only this time were the characters with god tier capabilities were starting to keep adding, also the plot of them character having sympathy for a buch of NPC that were nothing more than algorithms inside a main
frame was just too overrated that it starts to become annoying when the real threat were them mecrs whom were out to steal a very special girl inside the STL...and yes that's the Goddess of Light who goes by the name ""Alice.""
Verdict: 7 over 10.
Art:
Pros: Good customs, and some eyecandies and there was that brief Asuna's panty flash .
Cons: I was just the usual illustration from all SAO franchise .
Verdict: 7 over 10.
Sound:
Pros: the same set of seiyuus from all SAO franchise.
Cons: The same set of seiyuus from all SAO franchise.
Verdict: 5 over 10.
Character:
Pros: Here we get to see Alice being the main protagonist, in fact in this sequel it was them women turn to shine , also the addition of a main antagonist who is a grown up does spice up this sequel.
Cons: The problem was we never get to see an epic fight between them girls Asuna and Alice  versus the Emperor of the Dark Territory, also with the addition of Shion basically makes this sequel as to having too many god-tier characters that it was starting to become a one sided affair as they kick the asses of them US gamer hordes, so basically even with Kirito out of the way it would still be the usual since he was just merely replaced by Alice.
Verdict: 5 over 10
Enjoyment:
Pros: I still have the same enjoyment that I had when I first watched the first SAO anime.
Cons: I also have the same level of disgust when I've watched the very first SAO anime.
Verdict: 5 over 10.
Overall:
Verdict 5 over 10.
Basically what this is was just a repeat of the very first SAO anime, and quite frankly I'm wondering as to when will studio A-1 Picture and Original Creator, will pull the plug of this franchise. Cu'z quite frankly as this anime progress and keep repeating the same setting , it was getting way too overrated as to forget that they're in a virtual world and those NPC's  were nothing more that algorithms, in fact those people in that Turtle Island  would have been better off deleting those program in their STL that letting them mercs get that so called ""Alice.""
System's Call: Delete the entire program and make a new one.",Negatif
"SAO have the worst characters you can imagine, and this is not a breaking news to anyone, Alicization suffers from the same mistakes first two season suffered, mainly Kirito, Asuna and poor direction and character development.
this Arc is full of cliche SAO crap, ""Yelling makes attack smarter"", ""no hero dies"", ""one dimentional villains and heros"", ""plot holes"", ""girls want only kirito"".
Alice is literally the copy and pasted Saber from Fate Series, i mean it, but i'm gonna let this one slip.
Let's talk about the plot, so the villains are after Alice, but why? Asuna says because she broke the rules ergo she is a true
AI, let's talk about how fucking stupid it is that japan's military is looking for an AI that can breaks the rules!
Why would they want a solider that can break the rules they fucking gave her?
It makes absolutely no sense, let's say for some reason they want that, why didn't they just stop the project the moment Alice broke the rules? isn't there an alert or something that can notify the programmers? (if they can't for some unknown reason then it just shows how retarded it is that programmers weren't prepared for this)
Also it is pointed out that time is passing faster in Alicization, why? because we said so, if time is relative then why not speed up this stupid Super Secret project that a high school girl could find out about?
The warriors from Dark territory look disgusting, their design is abhorrent, it just hurt you eyes.
The Art isn't anything noteworthy it's bad, soundtracks are garbage as well, i didn't enjoy neither the opening nor the ending song
secondary characters are as developed as middle eastern countries, not a single interesting character, a character is supposed to have a background which we can relate to, people just show up and die and get resurrected to die again to show up again in the end as plot twist! this is what SAO always does, it assumes it's audience is brain-dead which isn't completely false!
The only character i had a little respect for was Alice because she wasn't after Kirito, that was the only reason i respected her a little but don't get me wrong, she is a garbage character, she is the most generic warrior i've seen, nothing about her is memorable, i'm gonna forget about her after this review probably
It is a bad anime, wasted my goddamn time again",Negatif
"When I said that SAO was best when Kirito wasn't involved, I didn't mean cripple the fucker and keep him as a background character.  Didn't mean for that advice to be taken so extremely.
Story:
Following the fall of the Axiom Church, Kazuto Kirigaya has been put out of commission thanks to a bolt of lightning hitting him during some altercations happening in the facility at the time.  With new invaders taking some partial reigns to the Underworld, war rises as the border between the Human Empire and the Dark Territory begin to crumble and fade.  Thus sparking 'The War of the Underworld'.
The story of 'War of
Underworld' is really about side characters and the surrounding battle that serves as the setting.  Thanks to Kazuto being out of commission, the show's screentime is devoted to building up the ins and outs of the Underworld (especially the Dark Territory's side) and setting up the stakes for the arc now that there's an opposing force in the real world that's actively causing mayhem and destroying whatever balance was achieved prior to the intervention.  However that comes with the need to explain and introduce the audience to these things, and that's where I think War of Underworld really starts to stretch itself thin.  So much of the screentime is devoted to giving backstories and little character moments to various knights and members of the Dark Territory.  The end result of that creates a lot of clutter where each facet of the battle is looked at and analyzed, but ultimately doesn't really move the story forward.  There're only around two major events in War of Underworld, both of which sporting multiple perspectives for multiple characters at the same time to get a scope of the entire battle.  It's nice for character development, but the story itself isn't very streamlined.
I also don't think the show...is as smart as it thinks it is.  Alicization is the arc in SAO that asks what the idea of the 'soul' is, now that AI technology has gotten to the point of being autonomous and equal to that of a human.  Part of the reason I liked Alicization was because the Underworld was such an interesting setting given how it's its own society created only by the machinations of its denizens' fluctlights and artificial intelligence, naturally flowing into the series through inference since its existence is hauntingly real despite it being a running simulation.  War of Underworld however really likes to shove that concept down your throat and constantly remind you that these Fluctlights are real people, doing so at such a rapid pace that even characters that've never seen or met these people believe and empathize with their war and their plight.  The ideology is made worse thanks to this arc's antagonist, who manages to be a record holder in the series being made instantly worse as an antagonist over the course of a single episode almost immediately he was introduced into the series.
The end result is a show that's more setup than story.  Given the fact that A-1 split Alicization in half, again, what we're left with are the rising details of the story without so much as reaching any amount of major climax.  Even without that, the story felt like it squandered its potential, even going so far as to reveal some details in the overall scope of the series that would've been great to see, but are things they'll ultimately never talk about.  The first episode of War of Underworld is such a great, somber thing to watch, and I was really hoping we would get more of that kind of emotional tug and yearning, but that kind of stuff just didn't really happen, and I'm all the more sad because of it.
Characters:
Noted as being equal to that of a vegetable, Kazuto Kirigaya (I really hate calling him Kirito) achieves a record low for the series, having not only the least amount of screentime, but also the least amount of speaking lines in all of his appearances throughout the arcs of the series.  I for one am not really against this change of pace, since it allowed the rest of the cast to shine instead of having him be the forefront, and at least let the impact he had in the Human Empire sit and simmer throughout the rest of the cast.  While I don't really like how at some point he will most likely rise up and kick ass again (as well as somehow get four girls to sleep near him without so much as moving a muscle), him taking the backseat let the rest of the cast be interesting and impactful rather than being either background characters or increasing the number of women around him, even though that one happens anyway.
Alice, given that she is the arc's resident female, transitions from being her own character into the series's coveted trophy that everyone fights over, which is not...that bad, somehow.  Ordinarily I despise character transitions like this since it completely slashes away any interesting parts about the character in favor of turning them into the object of affections that everyone involved wants.  It's gross and it feels like a detriment to the character.  Alice however circumvents this problem by still being an active part of the series as a knight in the war with significant screentime and contribution to the overall setup of the story.  While she definitely has less of a punch due to her breakout moment being at the tail end of Alicization, it's nice to have another 'companion' character be on a similar level to Sinon and do things on her own merit rather than because of Kirito, though that still kind of happens anyway.
And then for antagonists, there's Gabriel Miller.  First introduced as the leader of a merc group who's cold, calculating, and manipulative, Miller's character quickly devolves after a quick backstory scene to be nothing more than a psychopath who's obsessed with souls.  I don't get it; you had such a good setup, way better than every other antagonist in this series, and you ruined it.  While his version of crazy is certainly an interesting angle, it all feels hollow, forced, and just made to go along with the tone of the series.  Also I feel like what he's doing is going against his contract but fuck, what do I know?
Aside from MAYBE Asuna since she does end up becoming somewhat relevant towards the end, the rest of the cast fills in the roles on both the sides of the Human Empire, detailing little color stories for the knights and giving time to showcase the races and people of the Dark Territory, even though most of them end up as casualties at the end of the day.  I attribute them more as parts of the setting rather than actual characters, and help flavor up the world before most of them end up being eviscerated or cut down in one sense or another.
Aesthetics:
Like Alicization, War of the Underworld looks a lot like Ordinal Scale and really goes all out with the particle effects this time.  Due to the nature of fantasy battle, especially one where the swords of the Integrity Knights become various weapons of different styles and attack patterns, the art and animation of War of the Underworld is nothing short of a spectacle that has a lot of visual flair and boom effects.  There's drastically less swordplay since everything's pretty much just explosions, but they're nice explosions at least.  However because of the setting of the story, the colors of the setting lean towards a much darker color scheme as there isn't much brightness in the show, and day is nearly non-existent for the show past episode two.
On the note of animation, the usage of CG armies comes into play a substantial number of times throughout the series and it becomes very noticeable.  There're even scenes where the same animation loop is repeated several times over in one landscape shot, and copy/pasted over and over again at different intervals.  To A-1's credit, large armies are a nightmare to hand draw, so there's at least an excuse there, though that doesn't detract from how there are scenes where the hordes of goblins and giants are drawn out instead of modeled and pasted in.
I'm sorry to say that having Asuna('s VA) sing the opening is nowhere near as good as having LiSa do one instead.  ""Resolution"" is without a doubt a good opening and still has the high energy SAO feel that all of their openings have, but compared to Adamas or Resister (much less Crossing Field), there's not enough punch in Resolution for me to put it on the same pedestal.
But at least we still have LiSa.  ""unlasting"" is a big departure from the rest of the work that she's done for the series, being a much more somber and yearning song that is pretty on-par with the rest of the EDs for the series.  Its slow start and steady tempo makes for a great closer for each episode, especially since the tone of the series lends itself to boding well to ending on a slower song to close off the episode.  Made even better since numerous episodes have it as the background with the credits off to the side with the show finishing its current section of the story.
Personal Enjoyment:
Despite all of my grievances and complaints about War of Underworld...I still kinda liked it.  There's something about SAO that makes the episodes feel really fast.  While the content sometimes isn't all that good and story beats can be questionable at best, the overall tone and tension of the series was written well enough for me to at least have the desire to know what happens next.  Episodes feel drastically shorter than they actually are, and I don't know why.  Having Kazuto not be at the forefront of the series for once actually felt like a good narrative choice, and having Alice be the 'protagonist' this time served to develop the Underworld more now that things in the world are seemingly changing.
That being said, the pitfalls of SAO are still ever-present and I really don't like it.  Every antagonist has in some sense been some kind of petty, creepy, and weird psychopath, and Miller is no different.  The story also feels strangely similar to other arcs, boasting a at least mildly interesting concept before shitting itself in the last couple minutes with some asspulls and deus ex machinas to cap off this section of the overall story.  I've been watching this series for like seven years; I'd expect some kind of change to have occurred during that time.
While War of Underworld isn't the worst thing that the series has concocted (looking at you, Fairy Dance), it's comparatively less interesting both in-story and in execution to its Alicization predecessor.  It's that one awkward middle part that doesn't feel great to watch on its own, and the most it does is give series relevance to the expansive cast since the Underworld has an entire other half to it that wasn't given the time of day.  Still, I'm a little disappointment because as much of a spectacle War of Underworld was with its fights, effects, and several choice scenes, the season as a whole doesn't really have anything to it that lets it stand on its own ground.  Made even worse since it seemed like A-1 cut the thing in half, forcing this half of the series to have to stand up on its own.
Also this season feels like it was meant to be a throwback to the entire story told before it.  Was that intentional?  Because if it was, then where was Mother's Rosario in all that?",Negatif
"I'm not a big fan of SAO, but my friend is and a part of our deal is that if I am to give critic then I have to watch it.
But you may think: You just a SAO hater to be a SAO hater.
No. SAO is filled with plotholes. Big ass plotholes. It is filled with cheap conviniences (bc of the plotholes) and this season is no better. At least I can enjoy we not getting to listen to the annoying OP Kirito this season. Good for that.
To sum up: I didn't expect much going into this and i was not disappointed. It fills
out the usual SAO standard (Or any Shonen serie standard).
SAO was also one my introduction to anime, but being picky today many years later have given me a new light on this mediocre based series that can't really fulfill anything great.
It got good animation... and that's about it really. The characters is empty most of the time and whole their personality will flip on a coin.
Can you guess the main villain's character? Oh right he is a psychopath like any other villain in SAO. Nothing new under the sun there. Just another boring villain.
Alice is... meh. I know they made her a nearly emotionless character but really? Are we soon over with that monotone ass voice they gave her?
Oh and apparently Asuna should be in this season some more but look at this, we are 8 episodes in and she has like yet to have more than one line of dialouge or something. Honestly by this time she'll properly first be there to the boss battle and like... kill him off for Alice or some shit, bc Convinient plotholes is convinient. I know times goes faster in that universe, but even the villain came faster into the digital world lol
Welcome to the series with Convinient plotholes.
I could go on but honestly we all know that would be way too long.",Negatif
"Nothing of significance happens this season, so as a message to other SAO fans out there, skip this one.
The premise of this season follows the defeat of the pontifex from the season prior. Kirito's victory, despite losing people important to him, unfortunately left him in a coma due to some kind of short circuit. So instead of following the legacy of Kirito, the badass who manages to overcome every obstacle in his way, we're forced to follow a relatively new and bland character, Alice. From this alone, it should be easy to predict how good the anime is.
Story 4/10 - The season prior introduces
a new world of the Underworld in which a war is brewing between light and dark. However, this wasn't Kirito's focus in the previous season. As a viewer, I became disinterested in the war due to its irrelevance and instead focused solely on the overthrowing of the pontifex's tyrannical rule. That's why this season seemed completely useless to me. Kirito should have been pulled out of that world and life would go on and some other series or game would become the next focus of SAO. Instead the story of Alice is crammed down our throats as she, at first, only does mundane tasks such as feeding Kirito and taking him on walks. Not only have we lost Kirito mentally, but we're also forced to watch him in this state for the whole season, which is very disheartening. The story of the underworld is completely useless if not for its tie to the technological developments in the real world. Even if the war of the Underworld was relevant for bigger reasons, the story itself is boring. All 4/10 points for story go to the real life plot points.
Art 10/10 - The art of SAO is beautiful. Perhaps all of my enjoyment from the show is watching the fancy animations of the random large-scale moves by the integrity knights. It is what I expect out of a 2019 anime yet also always amazes me how far animation has come.
Sound 9/10 - SAO has always had a beautiful soundtrack. The brilliancy of the composers still remains heard in this season with another fire ED. The soundtrack during the anime is very good but I don't like the opening compared to other seasons of SAO. There are also callbacks to pieces in the original SAO but in a sad music box tone because Kirito is all screwed up. It's very well done.
Character 3/10 - Asuna and Kirito are characters that seem the most realistic to me out of most anime characters. Sure, people rant on and on about how OP Kirito is but it's more about their personality and interactions that makes SAO so enjoyable for me. Unfortunately, this season threw all of that out the window. The characters in the real world are cool, including the antagonists. Most of the characters in the Underworld are bland and pointless apart from a few Integrity Knights such as Bercouli Synthesis One and Sortiliena Serlut. Although not pointless, none are as bland as Alice. It's ironic because Alice is supposed to be the ""best"" soul in the Underworld, yet she seems completely robotic and fictional as a person. Her connection is that she grew up a bit with Kirito and Eugeo. That's all that makes her character seem like she should be cared about in any way. She acts as an antagonist for part of the previous season because of mind control antics, but given that a large portion of her life was in these mind control conditions, she still acts robotic and bland. Alice is a character that lacks character. Eugeo would have been a much better and more entertaining fit. This choice of following Alice is the downfall of this season and the biggest reason why it lacks enjoyment.
Enjoyment 5/10 - The art carried this category. Ooooo fancy lights swirling around. Explosions! Eye candy sparkly moves and cool fight scenes. When I stop for a moment to actually think about the importance of these scenes or try to follow the plot I instantly lose enjoyment. You know an anime isn't good when you have to only focus on pretty visuals to have any kind of enjoyment. Or maybe it's enough to satisfy art people out there. Either way this leads me to my overall score.
Overall 4/10 - Bad. Beautiful art and sound cannot overshadow the faults in the story and lack of good characters. I've rated every other SAO a 10/10 (a masterpiece on MAL) yet rated this season a 4. I got to a point where I was considering dropping SAO completely. I can't fathom any positive ratings of this anime, was the art really that pretty? I would give it a 1/10 due to my disappointment in such a brilliant series but I will continue to have hope in this series and in Kirito for his recovery. This season is like being served literal garbage at a restaurant and eating it because hopefully the desert will be good. All of my hope goes to the creators of this series in serving a desert more tasty than ever before.",Negatif
"Looking at the review scores for this makes me think that there's some parallel world where this show doesn't suck hot shit.
I've been avidly watching Sword Art Online since season one. I think the series as a whole is bad. The concepts in the series, however, are very good, and I personally attribute the high scores this hot piece of garbage is getting to that.
This bad boy's gonna have a lot of SPOILERS because it's easier to explain why the story is so bad when I can talk about instances, so ollie outie here if you care about that.
STORY (1/10):
Let's lay this shit out. The
first two seasons had VRMMOs, where all of the impossible and fictional shit happens, and then outside of the VRMMOs, everything is just like how it is in the real world. Now there's souls, which like. Ok, whatever sure yeah. Instead of doing souls to make artificial people you could've just gone the artificial brain route but you do you I guess. But the villain's main objective is to eat some character's fucking soul. What the fuck? Genuinely laughed when they were going through his backstory. What a fucking mess.
The whole story takes place during a war, as the title would suggest, and the story really doesn't try very hard to make any good points other than ""there's good people on both sides of war"" which like. Fucking obviously, this isn't creative. That point would be better if they even remotely tried to have anyone bad on the Good Side, but the most they've done is ""girl wants to cut things,"" but she doesn't do anything bad, so what's the point?
They introduce characters in an episode only to kill them an episode later, or sometimes even in the same episode. How am I supposed to give a shit about them if they've had 2 seconds of screen time?
So much of this story hinges on everyone being master hackers and it's genuinely laughable. Like 3 dudes break into a super future hub and then 1 of them hacks everything to make the most desirable outcome for them. I'm so tired.
Anyway, the story is absolutely horrendous, but is great to laugh at.
ART (8/10):
The art is generally very nice, and they've gotten a lot farther since the GGO opening with the embarrassingly bad CGI ground. It still suffers a lot from using CGI characters in the foreground instead of in the background, so there's a long way to go in that respect, but overall, there's a lot to love about the art. The opening is especially great, with transitions from each shot being smooth, and overall well animated. I just wish the budget went to another show, deadass bro.
SOUND (8/10):
All of the music is great, and it carried a lot of emotional scenes because god fucking knows the story wasn't going to. As is expected of something with such a high budget as SAO, the voice actors are all great in their roles, and are also contributing to the emotional scenes where the story doesn't. Pretty much my only complaint is all of the stupid ass bassy parts that make me feel like my ear drums are being sucked out of my ears whenever there's an explosion. It'll make an impact when it's used once, but when every single explosion is this mind fuckingly incredible event that warrants the firmament of your house to crumble, then it gets real tiring real quick.
CHARACTER (1/10):
I really hoped Alice wouldn't become a Kirito fucker, but here we are. Everybody Loves Kirito. Every so often she has something close to a coherent thought about... war bad? But then she's like ""I must fight for my loving husband"" and stops giving a shit. Why can't anyone just be thankful to Kirito rather than falling hopelessly in love with him? This isn't how humans work at all. When you can (AND LITERALLY FUCKING DO) fill a room with characters JUST FROM THIS AND THE LAST SEASON of people who are in love with Kirito, there's something stupid happening here.
Like I mentioned in the story review, characters are introduced and then die and you don't really have time to give a shit. Pretty much all of the Integrity Knights can be boiled down to one word (dependable, cowardly -> noble, etc.) All of the antagonists are literally just evil. You literally cannot think ""oh, I understand this antagonist's actions and sympathize with them even though they are working against good."" They're just evil, and that's the entirety of their character. The story doesn't LET you give a shit about them.
Having good people on the other side isn't new at all. They introduce a couple from the Dark Territory, and I genuinely thought, like a fucking idiot, they'd get time for their characters to develop before dying. That wouldn't have been bad; it would've been predictable, but maybe it'd let me feel something resembling sadness when watching this show that isn't just Why Am I Watching This Shit Bro. They killed them both within like 2 episodes. Why? To show that bad man bad. great..
Asuna had one singular moment where I thought she wasn't just Kirito Lovemail. She was close to having a moment of something resembling mental illness from all the fucked up shit she's seen, but then she got distracted and that was that. Thanks
ENJOYMENT (7/10):
Don't misunderstand this score. My enjoyment came almost exclusively from how stupid so much of this shit is. Hacker man. Soul Eater. Incredible. The other place the enjoyment came from was the opening and ending, because they are genuinely bangers and have great visuals.
OVERALL (1/10):
This season is the worst yet in terms of story and characters. I personally believe that an anime can pretty much only be as good as its story and characters, and that the extra elements just help to elevate it higher, but no amount of incredible art and sound can save this. I'm going to keep watching Sword Art Online because I'm a masochist, and there's nothing you can do to stop me.

"SPOILER ALERT
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
Im going to get straight to the point and point out some mistakes or just unlogical things I noticed in this season so far.
1: The battlefield likes to change its size alot
The Ravine likes to change its size. Sometimes it becomes much wider sometimes less wider. Somestimes longer sometimes shorter. Its so weird to me.
2: Alice crazy ass power move
At the end of episode 7 she used a giant laser beam killing tons of enemy troops. (So many dead cute sorcerer / magician girls). But she kinda goes through the entire ravine with the laser. My question is....How long was the
friendly kill list? Like come on....None of the friendlies have gotten killed from the BS moves the Knights use? Really?
And if all the knights (31 if my memory is correct) WOuld be there I doubt the enemy would have a chance. No need for the fucking army of normal humans. The knights wiped out 70% of the enemy in the first episodes of the battle.
3: The Backround fighting animations.
They are pretty decent I will say but.,..Pretty much all of it being a single animated fighting animation and then simply copy pasted and its all in sync....My.....Perfectionism CANT HANDLE IT!
4: In a way ive come to expect a victory of the good guys in SAO. Dont get me wrong I still love the happy endgins and all but....I want a bit more of a OMG THIS BATTLE IS SO CLOSE feeling. Yes Kirito is brain dead and in a wheelchair. But the Knights do fine even without him....Imagine if he was OK and managed to get Asuna and others in there.
The enemy might aswell learn about what a white flag looks like and the meaning behind it. Because I doubt any of the enemies will survive the battle. With the amount of power the Knights and the soldiers of the human empire have....The Dark territory has no chance.
This is more of me simply rambaling about random shit I thought was very....unlogical. Dont take any of it too much to heart.",Negatif
"In a series plagued with issues, War of the Underworld feels like no exception. However, much like most of Sword Art Online, I would argue there's enough compelling ideas and production quality to carry through and be an enjoyable time. However... take this for what you will, but, I think this is the least remarkable season of SAO, both in terms of negatives and positives.
Essentially removing the protagonist for a season is a bold choice. It paid off in spades the last time SAO did it (Mother's Rosario), but this time... meh. Problem is, the only particularly compelling new character in Alicization was Eugeo, who
got tossed aside in favour of the newest member of Kirito's harem, Alice.
In the last season, Alice started off as generic tsundere but at least had some decent character growth, and the premise of her character having no memories of her former life had some potential to work with (the old Alice/Alice Zuberg essentially being dead). This is more or less glossed over, as we're presented with Alice being close to her sister Selka now in a static relationship and barely interacting with anyone else from the village. There's some vague pretense of subplots of her self-worth, or her desire to fight, or the morality of the war, but none of these things get remotely touched on and Alice just stays static throughout this entire season. She's strong, fights for the side of good, cares for her friends, and has fallen badly for Kirito (because of course she has).
In other words, she's not a very interesting character, and the beginning of the show isn't very interesting because of this. And there lies the biggest issue with this arc. Without either protagonist from last season being around, the only characters left to work with in the Underworld are entirely new or very simple characters from last season (Asuna eventually shows up, at least). The show feels the need to flash a minute of exposition on the names of every Integrity Knight or enemy leader before the start of the titular war because it knows half of these characters haven't really existed. This is like, halfway through the season for reference, at that. Surprisingly, from this point forward every one of them serves some noteworthy purpose (although admittedly, the villains are mostly there to antagonize for a few minutes before dying). The show is able to pick here, being able to tell a lot of short stories about these characters and their battles, backstories, motivations etc while having entertaining action and eye candy visuals, but there's still only so much you can do with whomever fighting for 5-10 minutes, and it has to find ways to invest us in all of them in that time. I was pleasantly surprised with how much they were able to get out of this, but it still feels pretty shallow.
In terms of villains... I mean come on, Sword Art Online has never been good at writing particularly deep or nuanced villains (remember Kayaba's thrilling motivations?). If there's one thing it can do, it's create creepy bastards you just want to punch, and usually excessively creepy ones at that. We don't quite delve into rape scenes (emphasis on don't quite), at least.
We do eat souls. No, really, the main villain's thing is he eats souls. Preferably innocent ones. And he wants to eat Alice's soul, but he's also contracted by the NSA to bring them back Alice so who knows where that's going. Hysterical laughter occurred over this guy multiple times; he's frankly too edgy to take seriously.
The plot generally works, although it's mostly just very straightforward. However, there were a few moments I couldn't take seriously this season (Mostly aforementioned primary antagonist and his soul fetish).
For starters, the show doesn't play any pretense around the fact that Kirito's going to show up and save the day whenever they really need it, and even discusses this multiple times. I can't tell if they're acknowledging the absurdity of the Kirito harem at this point with the part where Asuna and his 3 Underworld girls gather to swap stories about him, but it's certainly a reminder. And of course, Kirito manages to... cure an Integrity Knight's PTSD by clenching his fist while comatose, because of course he does.
There's also the part where Asuna has cell service and Kikuoka and the rest have the ability to make phone calls and yet this isn't useful to deal with the hijackers/contact the fleet around the Ocean Turtle because... ???
Then there's the last two episodes. Sigh. I won't spoil things, but it mostly breaks the tension built throughout the war by drastically changing the situation while also making little sense on a number of levels. Wouldn't be Sword Art Online if we didn't pull some deus ex machina at the ending of every arc (exception of Mother's Rosario). And yes, I know this is technically halfway through an arc, but the problem remains the same.
I only have one major complaint about the production quality. Sword Art Online's always been pretty high quality there, and the same visual improvements Alicization showed are found here. Yuki Kajiura is among the best in the business, so the OST is still very good... except for one thing.
The directing is... off. I noticed it somewhat in Alicization, but it really stood out to me here. There are a lot of moments where the tone abruptly changes or feels off because a sad or happy song is randomly played immediately after an intense moment. There's one point where it builds up the start of the war to be all dark and intense for a few minutes, and just as the tension is sinking in and the fight begins, we get the upbeat OP.
While there's nothing wrong with any of the songs (in fact they're quite good and generally convey emotions well), there were several points the show just feels jarring because of this. There's also a couple god-awfully obnoxious sound effects (I'm looking at you last two episodes).
Overall, I'd say if you still have it in your heart to enjoy SAO, this season is passable. I went in with low expectations, and had a good time (although at points it definitely felt like laughing at the show). Nothing particularly standout about it, and it certainly still has flaws, but once the ball gets rolling it mostly stays rolling.
Okay, and Lisbeth makes a speech that descends into 'gamers rise up' and it's hysterical. No, really.",Negatif
"SAO Alicization - War of the Underworld. To be brief - utter trash. It continues the boring, contrived plot of the previous season, but with a twist - Kirito is kind of... not there mentally. Literally. He's lost all the personality he never had. It's not a particularly noticeable difference, though it does affect the general writing. There's a bigger focus on characters here and, ugh... SAO is not very well-known for its well-written characters. I could not give a single shit for anyone, as per usual, so this big battle arc was just boring as all hell. There were some fun enough to watch
over the top battle moments, the animation has improved over last season, which had some weaker spots. The music is decent enough. Everything else is just, well, shit. It was torture to watch this series showcase how badly it can execute excruating anime tropes, this time outdoing itself with one very special case of Engrish (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCMTyCUHy8U).",Negatif
"Alicization did great job setting up the world, its rules, and conflicts despite a rather shaky second half so it pains me that War of Underworld failed to follow-up on that setup. I went into Alicization skeptical, but enjoying the first half before being let down by the second half, and had hoped that War of the Underworld would at least make use of the setup and redeem the show, but awkward pacing, an identity crisis, and shallow storytelling disappointed me greatly.
I imagine the novels for this series were a lot more in-depth (to the point where I had to read discussion threads to understand
the point of certain scenes) but the anime suffers from terrible pacing problems and nonsense moments because there's times where they overexplain some details and it just bores me to death, but there's other times where scenes seem pointless or straight up break the established rules from prior episodes just because they don't explain it at all.
The show looks good but it relies on too many flashy effects for the airing so the practice of dimming adversely affected my enjoyment of the fight scenes more than other anime, and I feel like at this point, designing scenes to work around that limitation should be a standard. I love the soundtrack for the show, but it's way too repetitive, you hear the same tracks over and over again, many of which are being re-used from Alicization which gets tiring after a while.
Adding onto the pacing problems is wasting time on the introduction of many new and returning characters who don't really matter in the grand scheme of things and the show already has a bad reputation for neglecting its past characters. These characters barely get a mention, about an episode or two of backstory that we're expected to feel something about before they're tossed off as set pieces once again. There are too many characters in this show at this point, the show spreads itself too thin and needs to refocus on its past characters.
The show also suffers from trying to dip into too many different moods and lacks the ability to tell story with a consistent theme/mood as a result. It tries to take itself way too seriously at times with way too forward dialogue (show don't tell), but other times it borders on slice of life/harem territory. Some people might like it because it changes up the pace of the show, I personally hated it because I felt like the slice of life moments didn't really contribute much to the show and just held back the plot.
However, many SAO fans don't mind these negatives I mentioned or maybe they're LN readers excited for the adaptation. I feel that the studio is primarily catering to their fans at this point regardless of whether the anime turns out to be good or bad, because I notice that SAO's strong points like a diverse cast, world building, and showing off flashy powers, got stronger while its weak points like shallow storytelling, pacing problems, and bad characterization also got more exacerbated.
So if you enjoyed the rest of SAO I'd imagine you'd love this show, but if you were on the fence or leaning towards negative before, this show exemplifies a lot of SAO's problems.",Negatif
"This is a story about a simple gamer boy who finds himself to be one of the key persons who will heavily influence the future of Virtual Reality.
This anime arc is one of the few series where the spotlight will be swapped to a supporting character because of the plot and I find it very entertaining and great and it's not just some Isekai anime that we currently watch ourselves. If you want to watch this then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
In this arc, the new villain is sure evil from his backstory to his present goal and ego which makes you kinda admire and hate
him at the same time because of his intentions to the main characters. While the protagonist on the other hand was swapped from Kirito to Alice because she is the key character of this arc which makes it like a refresh.
P.S. Do not hate this anime because of its reviews, sure it has some bad character writings or arcs but it sure as hell fun especially if you're a gamer yourself.",Negatif
"uh boy what a dumpster fire. I realize that's not the best way to star this, but it really let me down, I really wanted to like this, I loved alicization and I was ready to love this as well, and the beginning led me to believe that, that would be the case, but it wasn't.
Let's start with the beginning, because the this season had a really good start, kirito wasn't around much and the show choose to focus on other characters, alice had a pretty good arc on the first episodes. The integrity knights had more screen time which make me really happy because
I liked them a lot in part 1. Some of them get extra development, the show also added new integrity knights like scheta and renly who were both freaking amazing, and probably some of the best characters in sao. Sure the villain was another villain who was evil just because he was crazy, but he was really interesting, and the rest of the characters in the dark territory had a lot of potential to be great villains. Definitly the best one was Ishkan, the relationship he forms with scheta although a bit rushed at the end, was really good.
But then we arrive at the second half of the season and it lost literally every sense imaginable, I won't spoil what happens, but let me tell you I was constantly saying WTF every episode at least twice because of how little sense everything had. There was even a point where I started laughing of how stupid something was. Which is specially a shame because during some of the most dramatic moments of the show I couldn't get invested because I was questioning everything going on.
Another big problem with the show is that everyone starts treating kirito like a god and he, once again, is overpowered, and it makes even less sense than the last time which is saying something. I thougt we were over this, everyone talks about him like he's the best thing in the world to a point where is ridiculous, which really hurts because in the last season it seemed that they learned their lesson with him making him more grounded, here he's back to being the best thing ever. The villain had barely any screen time, the dark territory characters and the posibility of creating simpathetic and interesting villains was wasted. The only good thing about the story on the second half was Poh, who was in all honesty a pretty interesting villain, although the show didn't took advantage of it's full potential.
As for the animation and sound is awesome, I mean is sao. There are 3 fight scenes with some spectacular animation, where sao really outdid itself. The only problem once again is that, out of those 3 fight scenes, I only liked one, because in the other 2 there was an endless pit of nonsense.
Overall this season was a bigger disapointment than the first season which is saying something. And look I'm not one of those sao haters like digibro and mother's basement. I wanted to like this season, I thougt that sao became awesome after alicization part one, but I just can't like a season which so much nonsense and wasted potential",Negatif
"The last episode is coming out next week, and I have to say WTF? Let's see where SAO started and where it is now. SAO's first season was a psychological thriller about being trapped in a video game where you can murder a player who will die in real life. Now, everyone has nonsensical god-like power from out of nowhere and dead people are coming back to life in another video game. All of which is for a giant world peace circle jerk of a battle. I literally through up as all the people of underworld (from both sides of the conflict of the war),
came together to pray for Kirito to win. This season is nonsensical and takes you from psychological thriller to heart warming world peace (video game world peace I might add). F the writer who F'ed up one of my favorite animes. I don't know which was worse, this or season 8 of game of thrones.
Oh, and BTW... if you are going to voice American's speaking english, then why not just get an American voice actor to do it? You have Japanese actors, speaking in a heavy Japanese accent, voicing as Americans. That was just awful.",Negatif

"As a proponent of the previous season of SAO, this season sucked. Like, no offense, but it just let me down. It's not like all my opinions on this season are negative, but a lot of the texture the last season had just went away during this season.
I still love the world that War of Underworld took place in. The possibilities that could be written in are endless, and it's still a massive breath of fresh air compared to the second season of SAO. Obviously, the art still slaps. The colors are gorgeous, the effects are mind-blowing, and the architecture still wows me. As
far as the characters go, the set of characters that were already present were really strong, and there were a few fairly interesting ones that were introduced. There were a few of them that I thought were written well, though we didn't see much of them.
But listen, y'all, the rest of this season just didn't do it for me. The story in the beginning few episodes and kind of at the end had me nearly as hooked as the previous season did. It took Alice's character and made her all the more intriguing. Once the war started, though, my interest waned heavily. The fight sequences were often brilliant when it came to animation and movement, but the story itself bored me. Whatever magic I found in the previous season just wasn't there this go-round. I'd attribute my lack of interest to the fact that watching it week-to-week just made it all seem stagnant. You'd get a fight involving one character one week, and the next week was the same exact thing but with someone else. And, frankly, the characters that got focus this season weren't developed well enough to warrant the attention they got.
I don't mean to gripe because it wasn't all bad. At the very least, I think it's set up nicely for what's to come, and the story for the outside world always kept me interested. I guess I just expected last season to be a reset for SAO, and instead of getting better and better, it sort of just flat-lined. I know there's a lot of people that'll disagree, but it is what it is. I'll still watch SAO as long as it's around, though, because it has the potential to be outstanding.",Negatif
"Amazing, isn't it? Somehow this new season of Sword Art Online was supposed to be the season where SaO finally became good again. I was seriously hopeful, yet it managed to not just let me down, but make me watch 12 episodes of pure brain torture. Never in my life have I forced myself through an anime which I didn't like, and never in my life have I felt so completely let down and honestly angry at how terrible the writing could be from what is supposed to be one of the most anticipated shows ever.
Spoilers all the way through.
I'll start with some good. The
sound effects within the Underworld are surprisingly cool. Whenever Sword Skills are used you're met with this interesting electronic glitchy bass-boosted sound effect, and honestly? I was seriously impressed. It gave the visual effects more power for sure. The ending song by LiSa of course was a complete banger, but I can't expect much else from her.
The art of course has always been great when it comes to SaO. I do however have to say that there was absolutely nothing truly interesting about it. It kind of seemed like they dumbed down a lot from the previous seasons. This is not how I remember SaO, the art seemed too lazy for this.
The only character I actually really loved in this one is the leader of the pugilist's guild. I honestly have high hopes for him in part 2, and really feel like he could play an impactful role. However, I'm not convinced that he will live through the first few episodes. I wouldnt even be surprised if they mercilessly killed him off early on.
Anyway, that's all the good I'm even willing to write, onto the bad. I think the worst part of the season was the incredibly horrid writing of characters. Never again was I so furious at the decisions made by major characters and their emotional ways of reaching their goals, I even wrote a word document where I allowed myself to rant over dumb decisions made by characters.
Through the entire season the writing was already very sub-par. I think we can all agree that the Kirito harem is fun and all, but just becomes an incredible annoyance throughout the season (cough cough episode 5). However, where it truly all went down the gutter for me was in Episode 7.
In terms of worldbuilding, we've learned that the people of the human realm are unable to murder other humans due to the rules of the pontifex.. which Asuna somehow later instantly assumes to be work from a mole in Rath, which makes absolutely no sense but we'll get to that later.
So, from this we know that Alice is not a murderer of humans. Throughout the arc we even see her turn from a cold integrity knight to a girl with love and empathy. Before she is able to create a nuke of souls, she monologues about how terrible war really is, as she discovers that all the souls of the people from the dark territory are just like their own. It's almost like she's starting to build sympathy for the people in the dark territory, since they're all just like her.
However, this is INSTANTLY thrown out of the window when Alice suddenly is able to commit GENOCIDE by wiping out hundreds of mages, all with human-like attributes. Slaying goblins I could understand, but she's literally killing hundreds of her own kind while they're screaming of pain from the burns. How is she able to mentally handle this, and how are there no lingering effects of having committed such an insane war crime?
It's unrealistic character building and extremely frustrating to see how there's an insane lack of depth in the character's and their actions. Nothing they do have consequences. Hearing her annoying apprentice suddenly coming out to then talk about his regrets of not doing his duty and all that is just extremely unrealistic. Yes, it's a fantasy world, but that doesn't mean the characters should have the emotional depth of a bloody children's bath.
The war as well seems extremely onesided. Every threat is completely nullified by minimal actions of a single person. When the dark territory mages create a huge nuke to try and take down Alice, it's COMPLETELY nullified when mister apprentice comes in after he has already flagged his death multiple times. The fact that the dark territory was RELYING ON THIS BOMB to win the entire war from the start and it being nullified by a single minor character is extremely stupid. Suddenly the entire dark territory is not even a threat anymore.
One integrity knight is able to stop the advance of an entire pugilist's guild as well, how does this happen? Why are the small stupid vanguard goblins more of a threat to humanity than the MAIN FORCES of the dark territory? It creates an atmosphere where you never fear for the life of a protagonist, because you know how weak the dark territory really is.
It's also hilarious that even though this dark territory was considered an insane threat over hundreds of years and that their invasion would mean the downfall of humanity, a SEVERELY reduced group of integrity knights WITHOUT the pontifex were enough to win the war, even though their tactical choices were terrible (from both sides of course, but why the hell are the integrity knights and Alice entering the dark territory when there is no conceivable rush to counterattack? They could've just waited for the dark territory to kill themselves again walking into the canyon).
Then there's all kinds of dumb moments that just make me laugh out loud. Not because of the good humor, but because of how ridiculous they are. Like how Asuna decides to jump inside of a meteor crater with her horse, which is stupid already, but then we see the carriages have safely made it down a 5 meter drop as well somehow. I have never seen a horse jump with carriages, but I'm not expert I guess.
Or when Asuna activates her ability and stands there like a soulless child mage while there's an entire choir that sounds NOTHING like her singing some kind of heavenly christian song. It's not that it's unrealistic or anything, it just looked stupid.
The troops of the dark territory are laughable. Why are all the piggy troops suddenly COMPLETELY fine with being EXECUTED, and how is there only ONE piggy that even remotely questions the morals of the sacrifice? I haven't even mentioned how the antagonists are some really depthless cold shits. The main antagonist is apparently some genius commander in gun gale online, but isn't even able to manage simple tactics in the underworld. It's like he lost all his brain in the dive, it's incredibly stupid.
Also, the way he was able to just swoop in on a big old dragon and take Alice away within the span of 5 seconds is so anticlimactic. How Alice allows this to happen so easily is beyond me. The main antagonist makes it look so easy I wonder if Alice secretly has Stockholm Syndrome and a fetish for brainless antagonists.
Anyway, all emotional cry moments are extremely hard to relate to. I haven't felt bad for a single character other than the pugilist's guild's leader.
The way the writers solve problems is also really disgusting. There's a very simple way to write SaO scenes. Start by creating a sudden and out of nowhere problem, have someone fix it with some weird ass technique you've never seen before, then create a flashback to when this someone was taught this technique that's somehow PERFECTLY made for the situation.
Example: Pugilist guild is running at Alice and Co. They suddenly THEN realise that there's no way to handle them, since using arts is impossible without natural resources, and their swords apparently literally can't cut through a pugilist's skin since they're trained for it. Bam, suddenly there's an integrity knight who start slashing through pugilists like their skin is made of paper. Flashback to the past, where the Pontifex gives said knight a sword that can supposedly ""cut through anything"". Oddly convenient, isn't it?
It's almost like they forget about the problem and suddenly think of a solution even though it doesn't fit at all. The story goes from problem to problem and solution to solution. There is only 1 problem that keeps popping up and that's the problem of what's going on in the outside world, where there is pretty much no direct development happening.
Next up are the extremely dumb moments concerning the American red troops. They come in and expect it's a game and all, but they don't know they're cutting down ""actual human beings"", which SUDDENLY BECOMES A PROBLEM AGAIN even though we saw a couple episodes ago that it's TOTALLY FINE to commit genocide when it's convenient for the plot. Also, one of the main issues for the Japanese to not log in in the final episode is that the pain suppression is off in the Underworld, but this is totally forgotten when the Americans WILLINGLY go and log back into the realm even though they probably experienced the horrific pains of being sliced into pieces by sharp bloody swords.
I don't know, Sword Art Online is a complete mess of writing where I only come for the action scenes, because that's all they've got going for them. You literally have to turn off your brain to be able to even remotely enjoy this, but for me that's just simply impossible. The characters' motivations are laughable and their decisions unrealistic, there's more plot holes than actual story, and we didn't even get to see Kirito being badass.
Great job wasting my time SaO, 2/10.",Negatif
"My review is mostly in regards to the art/animation of this season.
I think as far as SAO goes the story is fine but the art for me makes it pretty hard to watch.
Ive watched all SAO seasons, movies & read most of the manga.
I'm really confused by all the positive words about the art for alicization. I think the earlier seasons looked better & had more fluid animation than this season does.
To me half of the show is barely a step above a slideshow. Take for example, the floating dragons that don't actually fly. They're basically a still image just moving
around the screen. I can't help but laugh when I see them.
In fact I don't think Ive ever laughed out loud this much before while watching anime (for the wrong reasons). Or when Asuna is riding a horse (in ep 12. near the end) & she jumps into a giant crater & the horse kind of whimpers a bit then it shows a couple seconds later the height of that jump & it looks like a mountain! Or when the main bad guy grabs Alice is riding away on his dragon & he very abruptly makes the funniest face I've seen. Or have you noticed how you very rarely see a character in full view walking? Or how there are a ton of panning shots used to try to add movement to scenes. The characters themselves do not move! Their mouths move but they do not.
Ive also noticed characters have started losing their individuality too. Especially with the girls. The only differences between them seems to be their clothes & hair styles. Asuna doesnt look like Asuna anymore. Of course you could say she is just maturing within the show & the art is reflecting that but I think thats just an excuse. Her identity seems to be nothing but her trademark character colours. In past seasons this wasn't something that jumped out at me. The animation quality isn't a thing that immediately bothers me when watching most other series. This feels like the first time for me so thats why Im so bothered by it here.
The increased usage of cgi characters doesn't help either. All those identical cgi soldiers look terrible to me. I noticed the art style shift a bit since the Ordinal Scale movie. The lines are thinner & sharper. But those lines reveal too much inconsistency in the movements & details within the characters. I have no doubt it's probably easier to do cgi for a lot of stuff but it just doesn't fit in my opinion. I really hope that this is a trend that fades away. Its kinda like what autotune is to music, CGI is to anime.
I still love previous seasons & will continue watching SAO (probably) but the likelihood that I'll rewatch the Alicization seasons is pretty low.",Negatif
"After the highs of the Alicization arc, everything just plummets to absolute trash in it's Underworld continuation. It's one of the most artificially contrived and poorly written sequels I've ever seen. It's like the author died and a simple-minded buffoon took up the reins, throwing out all the characterization and buildup from the previous arc and jumping the shark to create a meaningless war with some of the worst battles and confrontations and deus ex machina I've ever seen in anime history that's so bad even a five year old will lose interest because it's so fake and unrealistic. I soldiered on for 16 episodes
but could not stand it anymore.
Let's get this out of the way first. There is a strong anti-American prejudice throughout the story, from multiple fronts. I tried to keep an open mind, but it just got worse and worse. Every villain and every evil deed ties back to America. The antagonist leads a para-military mercenary group tied to the CIA. He's a blonde haired white guy with a sadistic taste for indulging in the suffering of others and apparently, eating their digital souls. His right-hand man was also one of the chief player killers in the original Sword Art Online. The evil Americans are trying to steal the Alice AI so it can be used for drone warfare. They also fuel a war by having hundreds of thousands of violent, bloodthirsty Americans log in to the server to slaughter everything. The less than subtle smearing becomes even more obvious when players from China and Korea join in. The Americans were told to come join in to relish in a bloody war without sensory limits, while everyone else was told the server was being hacked and they needed to come ""save"" the server admins, because they were clearly in mortal danger in their own virtual world. If that sounds really stupid, it's because it is. The nail in the coffin is when the mole inside the research facility, revealed to be a principal offender during the Alfheim arc (complete with images of Asuna tentacle rape), shoots the innocent Japanese geek programmer and goes on an evil rant about how his diabolical plan to subvert the system was thwarted, how he wanted to kill Kirito, and how the NSA was very eager to hire him. It's especially ironic when this anti-American spiel relies so heavily on western fantasy for it's appeal and half the dialogue is nothing but poorly incorporated Engrish. The mole even ends his little rant by saying en-do ro-u-do, for end of the road. It's an odd existence, hating America but so delusional you continue to use the language of the people you hate in lieu of your own.
Even ignoring all the anti-American sentiment, the anime is still an absolute dumpster fire. Kirito is put out of commission in a made up subconscious coma so the other characters can have an excuse to exist. Asuna and others get god-tier accounts, but just like Kirito's made up coma, they have made up limitations, things like headaches that hurt their psyche if they abuse a god power too many times, and limited health even though they are supposed to be gods. They swap back and forth from nuking entire enemy hordes to acting tired, bloodied, and in utter despair, to nuking again. They are in absolutely zero danger but can't spend five minutes without dramatizing their plight against an endless sea of low level cannon fodder. Having their converted character disappear after death is contrived BS, and the fear of it disappearing forever even moreso. Even being able to convert to the server, and retaining god-tier equipment and stats not native to the code, is BS. Then we have the biggest horseshit of all: having hundreds of thousands of players from across the globe wirelessly beaming into one private server on a turtle in the middle of the Pacific. This is supposed to be a highly specialized, closed network in a classified, secure, advanced research facility that requires an STL within the facility to dive into the virtual world. One they had to fucking fly a braindead Kirito over to connect to. Yet somehow with a push of a few keystrokes, the whole globe can connect to it with zero latency and full destructive capability.
You are also introduced to some new characters who are just cannon fodder for the war. Leaders of each of the dark horde races, from orc to werewolf to dark mage. Their anguish is shoe-horned at the very last minute, right before their demise, hollow and contrived. And I wasn't joking when I said the battles were ridiculously laughable. There is zero strategy. They just stand there and get nuked. It's like a video game where you stand in a corner by a bonfire and watch one zombie after another walk into the flames and burn to death, because competent AI is hard. The axiom knights are ridiculously overpowered, bouncing from nuking everything to utter despair to nuking again, much like the pointless battles Asuna and co wage, the overdramatization of grief and suffering never ceasing. If the zounds of evil red knights besieging the highly stylized hero characters with flashy weapons and powers didn't make the situation obvious enough, then these players really need to get shot or at least sterilized so they don't spread their stupidity if they actually thought they were fighting for some false sense of chivalry.
The story literally does not advance at all. Endless wave after wave of pointless battles and unimportant characters dying and manufactured despair. Contrived powers and struggles between non-dying immortal god-tier virtual characters. And against the evil American onslaught, the faultless and benevolent Kirito and co continue to fight for all that is good and just. Oh wait, didn't the Japanese copy the souls of babies to alter and corrupt in a virtual environment to create the ultimate killing machine AI, leading to this mess? Let's just forget about that part...",Negatif
"You don't need a god-like character to create a blood pumping anime.
Story: Best, story arc, out of all of the others. You don't need a god-like character to drive the plot, you don't need Kirito to get the audience in the mood. Just like Re:0, a normal protagonist is enough to drive the audience up, and that is just why this story arc is better than any other arcs. 10/10
Art: A-1 picture, please, stop slacking, your work is weeping for your ignorance and shit ass fucking artwork. Hell, even some money-sucking hentais have better artwork than this. please. I beg you. 3/10

"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
I don't typically write reviews and generally speaking most of SAO I ranked pretty highly. Like 8 to 10. Alicization season 1 I really liked. But this one, I just couldn't get into it. I rated it a 6, though I initially wanted to get it a 4. And I only rank it a 6 because I enjoyed the first five episodes. The Alice focus then dark side of things focus. But after episode 5 it's pretty much a whole lot of time wasting nothing.
All I could think while watching this is where the fuck is Asuna? It's not until the end
of episode 9 that she finally shows up. Whereas the dudes that entered at the same exact time as her were in from like the third episode. That constant question on my mind was so frustrating that it ruined my enjoyment a great deal to be perfectly honest.
That frustration aside, Kirito isn't even really in this. And that I could be okay with, I suppose. Except with 12 episodes hardly anything actually happened. I would have enjoyed a season focusing on Alice's development, but even that really takes a backseat to a whole lot of nothing happening.
The battle scenes starting at 6 seem cool at first until you realize that hardly anything is actually happening. Then in 7 it's just a waste of an episode. There's cool elements in 8, but it really drags. The fight in 9 was entertaining, I suppose. But it seemed like dragging things out and developing characters that really didn't need developed. Just like episode 7. After the end of 9 the frustration went away only to be met by disappointment, and scenes that really dragged. Then more roughly waste of time battle scenes.
It's not that I don't enjoy battle scenes, because I do. But not when they just drag things out excessively long and waste your time like they're making a 500 episode shōnen. But it isn't. It's limited to only 24 episodes and they don't have that kind of time to waste on pointless crap dragging out single fights for nearly entire episodes. Single fights of irrelevant characters.
Then the more interesting random filler characters they introduced ended up just getting killed off moments after being introduced, within what 5 minutes? So it makes that development utterly pointless as well. They even then start introducing new characters just to randomly add development for them, to waste your time. It just seems like it was an overly ambitious project with not enough episodes for what they wanted to do, in any kind of reasonable way. And with the limited number of episodes they have they should have streamlined things to flow better and not seem so much like filler.
And the development they tried to add for Alice ended up falling flat without hitting the mark. You'll know what I mean after you watch it. They seemed to try really hard with one particular character. And virtually ignored an already established character getting some kind of development with her. That entire part was pretty disappointing and not done well. All of Alice's development this season was done poorly, frankly.
The art and sound were good as always. But the story really falls flat. I'd maybe even rank it a 3. The storytelling is where they really dropped the ball. And elements of that, like the frustration from bad story flow, dropped the enjoyment down to a 6 which really is only that high at all because the first five episodes I mostly liked, and I do generally enjoy action and combat. Though the time wasting aspect isn't great, nor developing non-essential brand new characters for nothing, and failing to properly develop existing ones - on multiple levels.
If you liked season 1 of Alicization then watch it. But temper your expectations. It's not nearly as good as the rest of the series.",Negatif
"SPOILER-FREE REVIEW
Oh boy, its that time of year again.
INTRODUCTION
At this point, I feel like I'll have to preface all my SAO reviews with this: No, I do not hate SAO, I thoroughly enjoyed the first season and a little bit of the second. I get that the fan base is almost oppressed to the point of bullying. If you look at my anime list you'll see that I've watched all of SAO, and Sword Art Offline, and the OVA, and the Sword Art Offline for the OVA. I haven't seem Ordinal Scale because I haven't felt like it.  I see lots of potential within
SAO and would love to see that be brought to life, but it just isn't. This is not my first review on SAO, if you'd like to check out my review on Alicization 1 then feel free too, although a few of my opinions have differed. A few months after I finished SAO II, I heard about Alicization, and it sounded good. Light novel readers were preaching it to be the be-all end-all to fix all of Sword Art Online. Now it could've, but it didn't.
STORY: 3.5 (Poor-Decent)
A good story should be paced well, full of impact, and be a catalyst for much character development. A story playing on the strengths of Sword Art Online would be very fast paced, and jam-packed with fights. Now this is not to mean to shoulder the story to make way for action, but instead to use the action to further the story. I cannot stress enough how much fight scenes are just thrown away in lots of stories. I don't mean that they don't write them in, but they aren't used to their fullest potential. A good example of fight scenes being used correctly is in My Hero Academia. Now if you know me, you know that I am really not a big fan of My Hero Academia, I can point out it faults for hours, but I still have to admit that they are able to consistently convey characters emotions, motivations, and feelings through the fight scenes, maybe a little bit too much. Now take this in comparison to Sword Art Online. Sword Art Online is able to do this somewhat well in the first half of the first season, but falls off completely in Alicization 2. The story is introducing tons of new characters, and its fights are a great way to explore those character's past and feelings. Instead, they only use this opportunity for a few characters in the show, making both the action and development shallow. Now don't get me wrong, too much development in a fight scene can be terrible, as flashbacks can disrupt the flow of the fight scene itself, and not all fights need development. However, no development at all leaves a fight scene empty and this goes for almost all the conflicts in Alicization 2. One argument that can be thrown against what I've just said is that lots of characters don't get development because they received plenty in Alicization 1. If so, then this should had freed up the pacing of the show. My second complaint against the shows story apart from its shallow development/bad use of fight scenes is the horrendous pacing. An action/adventure series like Sword Art Online should always be paced fast to deliver for action and development as soon as possible and to not bog the story down in too many irrelevancies. The Aincrad arc does this beautifully by shortening and varying arcs, which keeps the viewer on their toes. Alicization 2 is a mess. Battles take too long, important developments take too long to have an impact on the story which creates a disconnect, and sometimes we don't even see the main protagonist- who is supposed to be the shining light of the show- for whole episodes. Aincrad went through two years in twelve episodes feeling maybe a little bit too short, Alicization went through not much more than a week in the same amount of episodes. Its ridiculous, its slow, it bores the viewer, and it destroys the pacing. My final complaint about the story is that the atmosphere and tone is very strange. You can tell Reki Kawahara desperately wanted to darken the series, but fails a lot of the event's impact, which takes out a lot of suspense for further conflicts as you know the good guy will win, and throws in scenes which brighten the tone a bit too much. The story of Alicization 2 is all over the place, yet at the same time a painful, boring drag.
ART: 7 (Good)
Now to switch gears, I'd really love to take this segment to slightly praise Sword Art Online for a second.
The animation and art is probably the strongest takeaway of the show. While its nothing too special, lots of the flashy, ridiculous things performed in the shown are well supported by the animation and sound design. The show boasts lots of scenes where lots of people are moving, but I didn't really notice much CGI at all. As I mentioned in my Alicization 1 review, the color palette is much more vibrant and healthy compared to SAO and SAO II. Lots of the slip-ups in animation I found in Alicization 1 seemed to disappear in this new season. Character designs were also very decent. Shadows and light from weapons and such were on point. Fight scenes are handled very well as animation is fluent and smooth. A lot of this can be attested to the A-1 Pictures animation team and not Reki Kawahara, and this relatively high score can be attributed to the fact that its an improvement from previous SAOs.
Still, its nice to step back and appreciate a strong aspect of the show.
SOUND: 6 (Fair)
The soundtrack of Alicization 2 is not anything to go out of your way to check out. I feel that a lot of the ""intense"" moments in the show could've been a lot more pumped up if the backing track had been stronger*, however this is sadly the case with most animes. Sucks, since I actually did notice the OST in the first season of the show, and it complimented a lot of the fight scenes.
*STRONGER and not LOUDER.
I've basically become desensitized to SAO openings at this point, all I can say is that it is very average and not something I would regularly listen to.
CHARACTERS: 3 (Poor)
My least favorite part about this show. Often a show can be redeemed of its story's fault by having incredibly strong characters (ex. Bungou Stray Dogs season 1 and Danmachi), but the characters in this show all feel like pieces of wet cardboard. Everywhere I turn people seem to be praising the main protagonist of the story, which I cannot sympathize with at all. The main protagonist is essentially a copy of several other characters with minimal differences, which makes sense given context but does not make for an interesting main character. She does not shown much flair in the decisions she makes, which is ironic since in context of the story this season would've been the perfect opportunity to give her a more prominent personality. One of the show's most powerful characters takes a backseat for this season, which originally I found as a good thing but eventually started begging for the show to reverse. Lots of the other characters are very boring and share a relatively same past. While we do get small glimpses of each's story, it is not nearly enough to make the character likable in any sense of the word. Returning characters are only there to take up screentime, make the viewer go ""omg shes baaaaaaack"", only to keep the shows pacing as slow as possible when you'd expect it to speed up at that point.
ENJOYMENT: 4 (Decent)
If you've read my other reviews, you'll know that I consider enjoyment to be the greatest factor in watching an anime. Maybe not from a critical point of view, but it could alter your experience in a way which ups the score of the show. That is not what I experienced with Alicization 2. At this point I see watching SAO as a chore as I've already watched so much that I may as well see how it ends, so please end it already. I think the main two things that kept me from enjoying the show were the slow pacing and boring characters, which is weird since fast pacing and decent characters are what kept me glued to the Aincrad arc.
OVERALL: 5 (Mediocre)
I think that Sword Art Online's greatest strengths are:
-Strong developments made through fight scenes
-Fast pacing to distract from flaws in the story
-Strong characters that carry the show
None of which is displayed in Alicization 2. I can only hope that Alicization 3 fixes all the things I talked about, as I would really and truly love to see Sword Art Online in its prime again.
(I had been planning for a while to start putting a ""Focus Feature"" paragraph in my reviews which take a look at a particularly strong thing about an anime which I cannot truly do justice for using the regular paragraph prompts, but I was unable to find one for Sword Art Online: Alicization - War of Underworld).
Until next time,

"Ready to move on from Kirito and Asuna?
**spoilers**
Then this isn't what you want!
Honestly, the first few episodes were great. I enjoy Alice as a character and her development has been interesting, and I did enjoy the fact that Kirito was a braindead slob, although still too much time was spent on that... ""Oh, girls, lets all have a sleep over and talk about we love him."" Asuna is the female version of a someone who enjoys multiple other people vying for their love interest, hardcore fashion.
I loved the first half of the first season of SAO. I'm ready for new characters. The times where
I've gotten that, have been great, including the (more or less) first half of this season. Second half? Atrocious. Garbage. Rehashed.
People hype of the ""Alicization: Second Part"" to be the best part of the whole series, but with how they've built the beginning up... X to doubt. I'm pretty much tired of this series, I watch only to inflict pain on myself as they continue to rehash the same thing over and over and over.
I love the world they build but the characters they re-use to fill it, ugh. I'd rather take the Death Gun to the face.",Negatif

[NOTE: I WATCH THE ANIME BEFORE READING MANGA/LIGHT NOVELS, SO AS NOT TO JUDGE IT AGAINST AN OFT-SUPERIOR MEDIUM. NOTHING IN MY REVIEW IS MEANT TO INFLUENCE YOUR OPINION OF THE ANIME, OR HINDER YOUR ENJOYMENT.]
I was really pumped about this season. Alicization was my favorite installment of the SAO franchise, (imo, Ordinal Scale was the first one I didn't hate, and I liked Alicization because of the promise) and I was excited to see it continue, hoping for more of the stuff that Alicization did that I liked. Unfortunately, not only did it not live up to my expectations, it
also went back on the things that I considered the best moves in the anime franchise history.
Story - 5
I, mean, to be fair, story was never really an exceptionally strong point of SAO. But at least the first two seasons weren't in the realm of so absurd as to be totally disregarded as impossible. As soon as the franchise tried to discuss the place of a soul, and quantify it physically, I lost some interest and the story lost credibility to me.
The question of the nature of the soul is a really interesting question, and it's a good discussion to have, or to think about alone even, but in this medium, it just felt out of place. Or like it was only there to make us feel sympathy for the AIs in the Underworld.
Another thing about SAO that steadily becomes a bigger nuisance is the info dumps that get thrown on us, made-up science in an attempt to justify the technology that exists. You could say it's magic, but terms like Fluctlight, FLA, STL, and the numerous other explanation drops that are thrown in essentially amount to ""We want this to be sci-fi, so we have to use some scientific-sounding principles to get you to believe it."" It boils down to plot conveniences to explain technology that, honestly, didn't really need an explanation. It was at least interesting to see their take on it.
The pacing, though. Geez, I'd have had an aneurysm if I were watching this weekly as it came out. Over most episodes, nothing of consequence really happened. Even when it got the ball rolling, it was slow. 12 episodes later, and I feel I got about an hour, maybe two at max, of useful content that furthered the story.
Art - 9
It's SAO. It's always been one of the best animated and most visually appealing anime of the year whenever it comes out.
My only real gripe would be the addition of more and more CGI. I tend to dislike 3D in anime if it feels tasteless, and the placement of it here definitely felt tacky and gave it an unnatural look.
It's slightly understandable because this was about a war. There's supposed to be thousands of people involved, so in group shots, character design is going to be at a minimum, and 3D will be at a max.
Sound - 7
The opening didn't really do it for me, and most of the insert music annoyed me for some reason. I give it points for being memorable, though.
However, sound effects were absolutely on point, and the ending song just slapped. Loved the lyrics.
Voice acting was good, as usual.
Character - 4
This is where the majority of my problems with WoU lie.
Something I really liked about Alicization was the starting over from scratch. Creating new characters, and leaving behind the bland ones from previous seasons, who at this point, are fairly static.
Watching Kirito develop in Alicization with Eugeo and Alice, completely free from his worst defining personality trait of ""I like to play VRMMOS"" was so refreshing!
Kirito: Unfortunately, now he's a vegetable and no advances are made with his character. The only purpose of Sword Art Online: Vegetation is seemingly to bring back the characters I didn't really enjoy, and the characterization that made me dislike these characters seeped into this season as well. Let's take a look.
The tertiary/side characters: Side characters that had potential usually got a 5-minute backstory. They were then either killed or became badasses, never to receive as much screentime as in their small exposition. There were also a fair amount of the generic loyal sidekick characters, willing to die for their respective friends.
Asuna & Co.: As usual, willing to drop everything at any given time at the behest of Yui to rescue Kirito because (A-girls) they are either in love with him or (B-guys) have such a strong bro-ly bond and feel indebted to him. It's consistent, if annoying. And then they have the audacity to ask people they don't know to help them in the war by converting their characters to a game they might not even be able to recover their accounts from. And presumably, it worked.
Asuna specifically: Her whole jealousy thing with Alice. No matter what the anime wants you to believe, Alice isn't really a real person. She's fine with Kirito being surrounded by his unrequited love harem IRL, but he spends a few virtual years without her, and she's jealous? Kind of understandable, but still pretty clingy. Which leads to...
Alice [SLIGHT LOVE INTEREST SPOILERS]: Oh, poor Alice. I was really disappointed when they went back on the great things they did for her character in the previous season. She was established as a strong, largely independent girl, driven from within, but in this season, they shackled her. She's given up her sword to live an unremarkable, ordinary life and care for Kirito. Not only that, they decided to add the same personality trait as every other important female in the series: they decided to make her fall in love with Kirito. I liked it better when she, Eugeo, and Kirito were just friends, and would rather her have ended up with Eugeo or ,,,, the purple-haired guy who had unrequited love for her. Even AIs fall for Kirito. Jesus, what a time to be alive.
The villain [SLIGHT SPOILERS]: Another psychopath. No motivations other than, ""Yeah, he's just kind of a bad guy."" Presumably, he's killed multiple people in his past, not just Alicia. He started from childhood, too! Makes me wonder how the hell he got to be in a prominent, comfortable job.
Enjoyment - 6
Not as bad as being bored, or not wanting to watch it, but I found myself waiting for stuff to actually happen a lot. The ED theme was my favorite part of each episode (not just because it means the episode is over), but half the time the episode just played it in the background because story stuff was still happening.
Overall - 6
It looked really good, but didn't accomplish much besides that. Asuna took a ridiculously long time to appear, and I don't even like her. Mainly, her character design is always good, so teaser poster and OP made me wanna see the design, even if I don't like her as a character. A good watch for SAO fans, or people who want SAO to be ""redeemed"". A lot of people seemed to like it more than I did, so I seem to be the exception!
Have fun! :)",Negatif
"SAO was one of my first animes and I loved it. The characters were great and really pulled me into the story. The characters in this new series mostly feel like they are just there as plot devices. I tried to give this series a chance. But now I'm just watching it because I used to like SAO.
I started watching it at 3x speed just to get through it and found it to be somewhere around a 5 or 6 out of 10 in enjoyment. So if you divide that by 3 to get back to the 1x speed then that is a 2/10. Which
feels about how much I like watching it at 1x speed actually.
I'll probably keep giving SAO a chance, but haven't enjoyed it much since gun gale/season 2. I just don't have anything good to say about this show. I don't understand how people like it unless it is just for the visuals. I think the sci fi concepts are pretty cool, but I just don't think they focused on the characters in the right way. They just feel too flat.",Negatif
"There's a moment in this film when a little girl stands at the side of a street, watching an army of phallic-shaped tanks roar by. The animators made extra sure the shaft part of each tank dick, which protrudes to its left, passes directly over the girl's head.
If there's one compliment I can give the anime, it's that moment. The scene encapsulates perfectly how I feel having sat through this hour's runtime. Minute after drawn-out minute, Angel's Egg is a bunch of anime writers swinging their dicks at you, moaning how smart they are. Worst of all, they're right. This IS a smart film, and
it's probably going over your head, pillar and stone and all.
But ""smart"" doesn't mean good. You'd rather have a dumb friend who knows what he is and lives his life to the fullest, than be around a boff who does nothing but brag of the latest thoughts to pop in his head. Same with anime. I know because I used to be one of the latter type of people, except I really wasn't that clever.
You see, this film is unique. It's so different, it's so artsy. Surely that alone makes it better than the generic ecchi harem to come out every season right? Well, the thing with cliches is, the tropes themselves become tired because they have an inherent appeal. To someone seeing it for the first time, tsunderes are cute, no matter how shallow the character. To a 12-year-old boy, accidental groping is funny and awkwardly exciting. Not to insult people who like that stuff, of course; I'm just explaining the nature of tropes and how creators come to overuse them.
Angel's Egg is devoid of tropes not because it takes a fresh approach on portraying life, but because it's completely devoid of emotional appeal. Its ""plot"", if you could call it that, can literally be summed in two sentences. That's not what you normally call unique. It's just... nothing.
Let me expand on my point. This film is about Christianity and the death (abandonment) of God. That much I and most people gleam from the film alone; I watched a 30-minute passion analysis reasoning everything in the story, and I'm all like... That's it? As it turns out, Mamoru Oshii was inspired for this film after his loss of faith in Christianity. Everything in the story, few as they are, is some symbol relating to ideas of faith vs atheism.
Everything is symbolic, it's all dark and grimy and supposedly desperate. None of it is engaging. Because even as you can see the pain and anguish in every picture and song of this film (art and sound are fine), he doesn't give you a single reason to care. The characters are so NOTHING that you can't even call them one-dimensional, because that would imply they have some sort of breadth. You can literally describe them in one word; that's not just paper-thin characterisation, that's no characterisation.
I don't mind shallow characters if it fits the point of a story but this movie has their suffering as its only thrust. And it offers SO little to latch onto.
Okay, Mr Oshii. I can see it's affected you very much. I can see how these characters would feel lonely, whatever in this post-apocalyptic world. But you don't explore this emotion at all. Why should I give a damn about these people, or this world, or about you?
If you don't care about the characters, you don't care what happens. A few things do happen - FEW emphasised, each scene is so quietly, so agonisingly stretched out, I swear I could hear the soft masturbatory strokes of this movie's creators somewhere. Of the things that happen, none of it makes sense. It's all chalked up to being symbolic, nothing else.
I'm not the pedantic type. I very easily forgive a show for plot points that others call ""contrived"". But there's a line, and Angel's Egg is miles across it. At that point it doesn't just break suspension of disbelief. It's entirely unengaging.
""Oh, that happened. I WONDER what that means...""
""Oh, it symbolizes despair this, innocence that. Don't care.""
Geez, there's so little going for this movie to do anything. I have to wonder why it hasn't been forgotten. It has no philosophical or social commentary that millions of Woke atheists haven't already said. It contains no predictions on the progress of mankind, like Serial Experiments Lain had on the boom of the Internet.
I consider myself a fairy average person with fairly average tastes. I respect people who like this kind of stuff, and if you're one of them, give it a go. If you loved stuff like NGE, Texhnolyze, and SEL, you'll probably like this too. But if you're anything like me, don't. It's boring as shit, and you probably won't get it on the first watch. If it were that one needs to enjoy this kind of stuff for bragging rights, then I don't want those rights at all.",Negatif
"What exactly is a good anime? Is it perhaps something with high entertainment value, something that is truly fun to watch, something that you truly enjoy? Or is it something that conveys some sort of important philosophical message? Or maybe, is it a 71 minute long OVA that brings absolutely no entertainment value, makes no sense whatsoever, and conveys no message but that the director hates you?
""This is clearly a deep reflection of the director's mental state and view of the world! It's a deep, psychological experience!"" Yeah no, it's not. It's an incoherent waste of time with no characters, no plot, and next to
no dialog. It's just some girl with 0 personality filling up glass containers with water and carrying an oversized egg around. There's nothing deep about it. Nothing happens for 40 minutes, and then nothing else happens for another 20 minutes, and then the director effectively tells you to just fill in the plot yourself. Just interpret it however you want to! Tenshi no Tamago is the anime equivalent of shitty modern art. You know, the kind of stuff you see on r/delusionalartists. Pointless, boring, and with nothing of value.
I like to give credit where it's due, however. The art is very high in quality for something from '85. The music is really good, but unfortunately, it just doesn't play enough. Most of the time, there's just silence and nothing else.
Now, I know this is a cliche line that, at this point, holds no meaning, but Tenshi no Tamago's only purpose is to cure insomnia. Tenshi no Tamago is supposed to be thought-provoking, yet the only thoughts it provoked in me were ""Why did I ever decide to watch this?"" and ""Maybe I should go make myself some coffee so that I can finish this in one sitting.""",Negatif
"I'll Keep this short. Extremely strange. there's nearly no dialog in this 1:11 wonder. That leaves nearly no the entire movie up to the viewer to explain. It's going to mean different things to different people. I will agree with other reviewers that there seems to be an overall ""Christian"" theme. although that seemed to be put in a bad light with the ""Church"" having a stained-glass fish window (Jesus? or Regular Fish?) and all the Fishermen trying to spear the non-existent fish, and destroying the town in the process.I see that as saying religion is bad, others might disagree. I guess that's why I
gave this movie such a bad rating. I don't mind having subtle things put it  that make you think, however when the whole work is left to interpretation I feel you get nothing out of it. I could have just sat and thought for an hour instead of watch this, and received the same thing. I understand it's Art, but most art has at-least some focal point, a part that is firmly grounded, that the rest is based off. This had nothing. Whatever your views coming in will be the same coming out.",Negatif
"REVIEW IN BOTH ENGLISH AND PORTUGUESE LANGUAGES. (ENGLISH FIRST)
It's an anime that works like this: you play it any way you want. Yes, the anime has no meaning, you give meaning to it. For some, this is called genius. For me, that's called laziness.
The story is very stopped. It shows almost nothing the whole anime. The biggest focus of anime is art. Many people say that it is more important to evaluate this anime for the art, which is the focus of it, otherwise it would be like evaluating a comedy anime using parameters of action anime, for example. But the important thing is that
I am trying to judge the anime for being an anime, and if it presents me absolutely nothing for almost half of the entire movie, it does not deserve even a 3.
I have a big problem with good art animes with a bad story. If I wanted to see good art, I would be in Pinterest, Tumblr, Deviant art, etc ...
Of course, the art should be, at the very least, decent. But to focus on just that? It is lack of creativity, or simply laziness.
As for relativism ...
I like when the anime has a clear meaning. It is okay to have some meanings inserted subtly in the work, or even the famous ending left open. These things are interesting.
The problem is when an anime has no clear meaning and you, who watches, is who should give a sense to the story. Why is this a problem? Well, this only brings confusion and also opens space for the famous ""Overthink"", that is, people who see things in the anime where there is nothing!
I love it when an anime makes me have an Overthink, I even raise his note by making me go beyond what he proposes. But the problem is that almost everything in Tenshi no Tamago gets by its interpretation and therefore the whole anime can become an Overthink!
It is said that it is interesting to think about what anime actually deals with, and that there are several possibilities. Well, if the anime was not clear to the point that several people are theorizing about what happened there and about what it all means ... WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL THAT? OF ALL THE WORSHIP THAT ANIME RECEIVES?
I can not understand ... Am I a little dumb kid?
It is not my laziness to think and give meaning to the work, seriously. I just do not like to have lost 1h and a few minutes of my life seeing something that does not make any sense at all.
EM PORTUGUÊS:
É um anime que funciona da seguinte maneira: você interpreta ele da forma que quiser. Sim, o anime não tem sentido, você que dá o sentido pra ele. Para alguns, isso se chama genialidade. Para mim, isso se chama preguiça.
A história é muito parada. Não é mostrado quase nada o anime todo. O maior foco do anime é a arte. Muita gente diz que é mais importante avaliar esse anime pela arte, que é o foco dele, caso contrário seria como avaliar um anime de comédia usando parâmetros de animes de ação, por exemplo. Mas o importante é que estou tentando julgar o anime por ser um anime, e se ele me apresenta absolutamente nada por quase que a metade do filme inteiro, ele não merece nem um 3.
Eu tenho um grande problema com animes de arte boa e enredos ruins e/ou sem sentidos. Se eu quisesse ver arte boa, estaria no Pinterest, Tumblr, Deviant art, etc...
Claro, a arte deve ser, no mínimo, decente. Mas focar só nisso? É falta de criatividade, ou simplesmente preguiça.
Quanto ao relativismo...
Gosto quando o anime tem um sentido claro. Tudo bem que possa ter alguns significados inseridos de forma sutil na obra, ou até o famoso final deixado em aberto. Essas coisas são interessantes.
O problema é quando um anime não tem sentido claro e você, quem assiste, é quem deve dar um sentido à história. Por que isso é um problema? Bem, isso só traz confusão e também abre espaço para os famosos ""Overthink"", isto é, pessoas que vêem coisas no anime onde não tem nada!
Adoro quando um anime me faz ter um Overthink, eu até aumento a nota dele por me fazer ir além do que ele propõe. Mas o problema é que quase tudo em Tenshi no Tamago fica por sua interpretação e, portanto, o anime todo pode se tornar um Overthink!
Dizem que é interessante pensar sobre o que o anime trata na realidade, e que há várias possibilidades. Poxa, se o anime não foi claro ao ponto de várias pessoas ficarem teorizando sobre o que aconteceu ali e sobre o que tudo significa... QUAL É O SIGNIFICADO DE TUDO ISSO? DE TODA A ADORAÇÃO QUE ESSE ANIME RECEBE?
Eu não consigo entender... Será que sou burrinho?
Não é preguiça minha de pensar e dar sentido à obra, sério. Eu apenas não gostaria de ter perdido 1h e poucos minutos da minha vida vendo uma coisa que não faz sentido algum, só isso.",Negatif
"This is one of those curious pieces that I can safely say I didn't enjoy very much, but am still  glad I watched and would recommend others watch as well. It's just so unique and at only an hour long it's not a huge time commitment (although it will likely feel much longer).
I expected to like this going in. I'm usually very open to ""difficult"" pieces of media. Gene Wolfe is my favorite author, after all, which is actually how I came to this movie in the first place, as many people on the internet seem to think it was directly inspired by
The Book of the New Sun in some meaningful way and having watched it I guess I can see where they're coming from but the connection is slight if it's there. A cloaked young man bearing a cross-shaped weapon in a dying world of ancient architecture mixed with strange futuristic technology, a focus on flood imagery and rebirth, etc.
I think the main disconnect for me here is that this is very obviously a piece of visual art rather than a difficult or abstruse story, which is what I was expecting. In reality, there just isn't a story. The director himself has said he doesn't know what the movie is about, and while I don't think there's anything wrong with making a movie that way, I feel like I could absolutely tell the difference. There are plenty of things I've watched/read that I was completely perplexed by, but somehow could tell that at least the creator knew what it was about and thus there was some internal logic there that I could latch onto and perhaps puzzle out if I spent the time on it or looked into what others had found out. With Angel's Egg, that way lies madness and dissatisfaction.
Beyond a very surface level symbolic interpretation that it's probably, to some degree, about his loss of faith in Christianity, hence all the religious symbolism and the longest dialogue scene being a recounting of Noah's flood with a dark and nihilistic twist at the end, there's just nothing here beyond the visuals, which are pretty open to be interpreted however somebody wants to interpret them. I am very much a student of storytelling, not a student of visual art. Don't get me wrong, I like and appreciate cool art, but I've just never been one to get super invested in a painting. I prefer when that art is in service of something else, like a fun video game, or a great story, which this was not. It is, instead, a painting that moves for about 67 minutes and then ends. If you've ever been to an art museum and stared at a single painting for 20+ minutes, this is probably the movie for you.",Negatif
"Story: I am actually editing this! Ok so i have just had a long conversation with someone about this, and my opinion has not changed. however i do feel i need to be a little clearer on my opinion.
I found this movie difficult to understand, mostly for the fact that it seems to be saying something deep, which in itself is not a problem. The problem is that what it's saying is so easy to interpret in so many different ways that the actual meaning is lost.  As such i dislike the way it presents itself.
It's painfully obvious to me that it's
mostly a take on Christianity. However to what degree and what opinion is questionable. Also i have heard opinions that take very little stance of religion into account, and who's to say i am any more correct than them.
Art: I think would describe this movie as something that Salvador Dalli would make if he was an anime designer who lived in a one window apartment across from a church.
Beautiful, creepy, and surreal.
Sound: I don't really have much to say about the sound except for that it works with the rest of the film very well.
Character: Well you see there are only a few min of dialog in the hole film, and probably 75 percent of that is quotes (or slight variations) from the Bible.
what does this mean? it means that you lose the direct access to the minds of the characters, you are left wondering what they are thinking and why are the acting this way.
The hardest part is that the people act really oddly so trying to figure them out is really hard.
Enjoyment: I like artwork in anime so that let me enjoy this to some degree. If that were not the case i would have been rather put out.
I would suggest this anime to anyone who wants to be confused and annoyed, or anyone who likes seeing different styles of anime. Or people who like surrealism",Negatif
"Angel's Egg is uniquely brilliant in that what it set out to do, it accomplished masterfully.
Subtle imagery is often held with high regard as it adds nuance and a level of detail to storytelling that is invaluable. Angel's Egg uses a similar technique that is the literal opposite. Instead of using subtle imagery to enhance the telling of a story, Angel's Egg uses a towering amount of imagery as its form of storytelling altogether.
In this review, I want to contrast different viewpoints on Angel's Egg's method. I was not the intended audience of Angel's Egg, but former internet personality Sudostef was. I will
describe his ideas, with solemn remembrance and respect giving full credit to him, solely as a contrast to my ideas. I don't have anything to cite as he has removed all of his work from the internet.
[The Masterpiece...]
Sudostef describes this blatant imagery as a means of establishing an atmosphere. He then describes this effective use of the atmosphere as inciting strong emotion and nostalgia. And primarily because Angel's Egg is triumphant in this matter, it is a masterpiece, albeit an abstract one.
If you have a deep appreciation for artistic films and masterful imagery, you too are the intended audience of Angel's Egg and you probably won't find anything better anywhere. I am not this person.
I value imagery as a means of storytelling and not as being the story itself. Sudostef says that when it comes to abstract art like Angel's Egg, you either hate it or you love it. I'm here to be that happy medium. I don't hate it, but I don't value it highly either. That doesn't mean I can't see its genius.
Angel's Egg, being abstract art, will have a different meaning depending on who is viewing it. To me, it set out to do one thing: make me feel hopelessness. I have never felt more overwhelming hopelessness as I did watching Angel's Egg. 10/10 in that regard; I will express it in my art score.
The other thing the art did for me is ingrain itself in my brain. I watched Angel's Egg about an hour before writing this and I can recite every scene in order. I can tell you already that I will never forget certain scenes like the weird flying eye spaceship thing or the military-looking dudes hunting the shadow fish. Images like that stay with you forever. Angel's Egg is a master at creating such images.
[...That Wasn't for Me]
Appreciating the brilliance of something isn't equivalent to valuing it. I want a compelling narrative. I want compelling characters. Angel's Egg gives me neither. And though being as abstract as it is, one may go searching for meaning indefinitely in Angel's Egg, on a surface level, it's not there.
Sudostef goes on to analyze the religious and identity-related themes in Angel's Egg. And though the imagery to support a religious narrative is there - the title, the bandages on the hands, the cross, the bible monologue, etc - this narrative is not particularly deep or valuable to me. Even if everything is there as he describes, it's still not notably good. It's creative and innovative, but not good.
[Conclusion]
Angel's Egg, at what it does, is a masterpiece. There is no doubt in my mind about that. If you watch it, you will never forget it. But to me, as a form of literature/film/anime, it's not quite there.",Negatif
"A girl cradles an egg.
She carefully puts her ear on it and is in awe of the themes and symbolism this show carries. ""I can understand it"" she whispers.
A man looks down on the child with pity.
""That's not real understanding. It's the illusion of it to look smarter.""
The girl denies, clutching the egg even tighter.
I'm breaking the egg and facing the reality of not getting this OVA.
I really wish I could. I absolutely adore the art, the imagery, the creepy setting, the eerie music, the state of mind it leaves you in. All stellar.
But when you are watching a shot of a window
for 10 full seconds and nervously moving your mouse to see how much of the film you need to slog through, it's just not enjoyable. My mind wandered off more often than not as shots with no consequence seemed to go on for what seemed forever. The nearly non-existent dialogue wasn't a deal breaker, but with how little was happening on screen, I had very little to grasp to keep myself entertained.
Angel’s egg is a work of art, with clever themes and symbolism in it. After finishing it, I devoured many essays dissecting it all and was impressed by what was being communicating on screen without me even knowing. And that's exactly the problem. I didn't realise many of them.
Maybe this problem relies solely on me. Maybe 3 am wasn't the best time to sit and watch this story, when my mind was already drowsy with sleep and hoping to end the day soon. Maybe I'm just not smart enough for it. Whatever the cause, if you need to look up explanations after a film is over to truly enjoy it, I can't with a good conscience clutch that egg more and put this show a higher score.",Negatif
"I've been meaning to watch this film for the longest time, and at last I have. I normally would not review an older anime, but I really feel the need to write this one.
Angel's Egg is a 1980s anime with a DVD which is exceptionally hard to track down (I'm even surprised I did. Libraries never cease to amaze.) The story takes place in a rapidly decaying world where a young girl lives her life, always carrying a large egg by her side. As she is gathering water and such, a young swordsman crosses paths with her and they continue to walk through the world
speaking to one another. Much of their conversations involve their views of the present world.
I found the story itself to be quite good, personally. I've always been somewhat of a sucker for post-apocalyptic atmospheres if done without too much heavy depression. This movie definitely held that depressed feel, but a more haunting and dark element mainly composed the movie. There was also some religious mention weaved into the tale, which interests me sometimes in things I don't expect. By the end, the representation of a story with the film's characters shown was impeccable. The only downfall I found to to it was its pacing: this film had so many long pauses that I actually felt like I was going to fall asleep. I had to rest my eyes a few times because of it. However for a rating, I'll give Story a 9/10.
Artwork and animation is sort of expected to not be entirely top-notch when the anime is an old one. Heck, even older than me! That being said, I actually liked the artwork a lot. You can tell that a lot of work went into the animation as well, especially with the little girl's hair: animating every strand of that must have been a nightmare. But nonetheless, they really did a spectacular job with its art. 9/10.
The soundtrack had a lot of opera as well as haunting sort of pieces. I found that since the movie was silent for a good portion of it, a lot of the music was out of place. The volume they put it at did not help any either. Despite that, the music itself wasn't entirely terrible. I'd give it a 7/10, but it would not be nearly good enough for me to buy.
As I said before, a lot of this movie was silent; meaning very little dialogue for a long time. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but when you are introduced to a little girl who always has an egg on her person, you're wondering who she is and why she has that item. The girl does not speak for a VERY long time, and I found this difficult to adjust to. As the audience, I wanted to know her character. What I was given was a small (and rather capable) girl running around a dying land for 15 minutes merely gathering water in bottles and hugging the egg close to her. When she met the swordsman, I became a bit more hopeful: maybe another character can get her to talk. With two people, you'd expect dialogue. When they first meet, neither of them say a word. Not one. She merely just runs away and hides from him, only to find him another 15 minutes later. It is THEN that they both decide to take a gander at some dialogue. With this, I didn't like knowing so little about either of them. They also lacked a great deal of emotion for a long time (which was understandable enough because of their situation, but the outlier was the care this little girl was showing for that egg!) Character recieves a poor 5/10 from me.
Overall, I would say that I didn't exactly waste around an hour watching this film, but I didn't love everything during that hour. The pacing of the movie was unbelievably slow. I have not been inclined to quite literally fall asleep due to uninteresting pacing ever since The Sky Crawlers. The story had potential, and it was able to flaunt its potential well at around the midpoint. Still, there were several long pauses and still shots that were just too long. If the structure had not been so snail-like, this movie would have gotten a better rating from me overall. After all, the story combined two of my favorite things in anime: post-apocalyptic setting without a hugely heavy dose of depression, and religious/mythical mention. So if I had to give it a rating for Enjoyment, it would be a 5/10. However my overall rating for this movie is a 6/10. The story is what drove me to put it one point higher than I normally would.
I would recommend this film if you like more... lets say 'abstract' kind of anime. This movie is definitely different from anything I've seen. Also, if you're interested in piecing together an animated story and a mythical/religious story to try and figure out what character represents who and all that fun stuff, you would probably like this a lot.",Negatif
"My first review:  Story moves way too slow for it's own good. The aesthetic is very unique and interesting but because of the movie's horrible pacing and it's on the nose metaphors and symbolism; my rating is lower. You need to have a particular mindset to enjoy this, and I guess I didn't have it. It's pretty easy to understand the ""plot"" of Angel's Egg. Little girl explores a surreal world protecting a egg, she fails and then she dies. Simple. But that's not what the movie wants you to pay attention to. It wants you to think and question the world she’s in,
what's it's purpose, why is it like this, etc. It wants you to question reality basically. That's all interesting but at least don't drag out. Scenes with little importance are drag out to minutes without anyone moving or doing or saying anything, just staring at nothing. It doesn't reveal anything and it comes off as agonizingly boring. This film is not prestigious mind you but it’s just really really repetitive which feels intentional (probably is), but if that’s the case, this is not a film for me.",Negatif
"Angel's Egg is kind of cool, but Angel's Egg is very boring. Does it have value? I mean I guess -- visually, it is truly one-of-a-kind. This dystopian, hyper-gothic horror atmosphere is definitely unique to this movie, and definitely a bit creepy. If that is what you want from your movies, or you are interested in learning new aesthetics, this film is certainly worth watching. But if you're judging the whole package, you'd be hard-pressed not to say that Angel's Egg moves unbearably slow and there's not much for the audience to invest themselves in. Like seriously there's maybe 3 moments in the whole movie
where anything actually happens that were even a little interesting. It is one of the VERY few movies that I nearly fell asleep to.

"Some things need to stand alone.
Sequels are a gamble, especially when the time gap between original and sequel grows and grows. They tend to be put under more scrutiny than their predecessors, as they not only have to deal with standing tall as installments in their own right, but they need to provide merit as a sequel to a product that never needed one. The trickiest prospect involved is the anniversary sequel, as that is where you’re most likely to enact the gambit. Some projects of this nature can pay off in a way that respects the original and becomes its own product, perhaps even
succeeding it in the process. However, not everyone can do a Turn A Gundam, and instead, some make Diebuster.
Put it simply, it fails both ways. As a series, it features mediocre at best and largely uninteresting characters, half-assed power-up moments, and tons of convoluted and barely explained sci-fi superpower bullshit & worldbuilding. When the highlight in terms of memorable character moments was a rape attempt, you know you’ve fucked up. As a sequel, Diebuster’s almost insulting. The writers made a completely different type of show -a mediocre one at that- a sequel to Gunbuster. It would be like making Aldnoah.Zero the sequel to Macross. As such, everything about the already poorly-crafted and convoluted world-building (galaxy building?) is brimming with incompatibility.
Buster machines are now biomechanical machines that can only be piloted by people with some hereditary superpower gene rather than robots that take skill for any able-bodied person in general to pilot. They each come with different powers including the ability to freeze space creatures in space with quantum temperatures, and controlling and turning other ships into creatures to use during battle via psychic powers or something akin to that. They have colonized entirely new planets with futuristic military technology, yet transportation technology and all things not inherently related to war against space creatures has yet to advance beyond 2004 —the year this OVA first aired— until the finale outright contradicts that. The finale also proves that it takes place during a specific portion of the original’s finale, as if to self-destruct while getting its idol caught in the explosion. Additionally, whereas Gunbuster used real, hard science for its science fiction, Diebuster uses pseudoscience superpower nonsense. This and more serve as only a taste of how incompatible (for lack of a better word) the world-building is, and why crafting a coherent world is always important. Otherwise, we get two pieces that just cannot fit.
There’s also the fact that the mere existence of the events in Die, even discounting the monumentally awful finale, ultimately sully the finale of the original Gunbuster. Not only did that show end phenomenally, but it did so in a way in which no real sequel could be warranted. Gunbuster ended so conclusively that to continue would be to retroactively take back part of the point of the finale. This isn’t even touching on the world-building. This show really should have been its own thing. It would have been a mediocre at best show, but better a mediocre separate celebration installment than a show that accidentally knocks over its predecessor’s grave, especially when said predecessor became one of the two foundational anime of its studio. However, it would probably require heavy rewrites towards the end in particular. After all, the more it goes on, the worse it gets, peaking in its concluding episodes in terms of sheer atrocity, as the show stops caring almost entirely and ends up outright nullifying the ending of the original, at least canonically.
To cover the positive —read: superficial— aspects of this asteroid, the music is better than last time, and the visuals are still mostly well-crafted. Even with the awful mech designs excessive amounts of usually terrible CGI, the show’s visuals are worthwhile. The character designs are fine enough -particularly that of Nono- and the action animation is smooth, kinetic, and kept track of extremely well...as long as the characters aren’t running. It may not hold up compared to the immaculately detailed and stylized predecessor of yore, but disregarding that leaves you with visuals that were on par with that best at the time, at least animation-wise. The sense of scale is quite large, to add on top of that. Lastly, the music is honestly a tad superior than the original, at least when it isn’t remixing tracks. The OP and ED themes are ok and the background music is serviceable, though that is all I can praise.
Ultimately, the more this show goes on, the more horrible a sequel it becomes. As if it wouldn’t be a bad enough show on its own, it just had to throw a classic series under the bus in a drunken attempt at paying homage and joining a franchise. Barring the prospect of bastardizing a returning cast, Diebuster commits every sin a sequel can commit -including ones I never thought were possible- and ends up shattering itself into pieces upon its obnoxious attempts at trying to send-up and one-up. On its own, it's a mediocre turned bad show too ambitious for its own good. As a sequel, it is so...so much worse. Way to go Gainax, producing the worst thing in your mainline repertoire to celebrate 20 years!",Negatif
"Top wo Nerae 2! Diebuster is a hard anime to review. Basically because it is hard to analyse it without comparing it to its prequel. However: that isn't wrong, considering it IS a sequel and it does connect with the original OVA. Furthermore, it tries to conclude with various references to Gunbuster so rather it would be futile to look at it as a stand alone work and it couldn't be appreciated without the comparison either.
Having said that - the story of Top wo Nerae 2! Diebuster isn't sublime. For one, it lets go of the realistic, more scientifically organized orientation that the first OVA
set and picks up a rather far fetched fictional approach. That is mainly a neg as a sequel. Pushing technology ahead is one thing, but just coming up with ideas that seem to be written at a drinking party doesn't suit the anime as a sequel. Gunbuster set the universe as a futuristic approach to our present universe where technology had advanced, not a magical realm of superhuman races. That also reduced the attribute of tension that was prevalent in Gunbuster and brought the possibility of doing 'magical' stuff that doesn't suit the plot line of mankinds survival.
Secondly, there were plot holes. There were ideas poorly connected - there were ideas that spawned out of nowhere as if the story was not thought out properly in the start and at times there was no good transition from one event to another. And furthermore, small internal plots and politics that was added, brought little appeal to the show - they seemed like excuses to make the plot deep with a lot of stuff going on. This further gave little room for the main characters to interact and give off a more 'emotional' show that would have saved it some face. And just to add - the plot gave too much a feel of ""Outlaw Star"". The Serpentine Sisters seem like the Mcdougall brothers. The ending fight seems similar and there is a more of the 'chi'/power concept making it look like an Outlaw Star universe.
As a standalone plot, it would save more face - we would have to accept that it is a universe with certain abilities and fictional elements however it still doesn't deliver. There are still many more negatives like plot ones mentioned above - even as a standalone anime, it lacks a very good unique or well executed plot.
Now it may be my personal choice but the extremely vibrant, and girlish outlook of the characters didn't appeal to me. That however is a comment due to the comparison with Gunbuster; if we overlook that I did like the art in general, the fluidity, the backgrounds and color schemes. I would still say I find more appeal to the art style and execution of the original but picking on Diebuster at this point will be a very biased approach.
The characters were another weak thing about the show - Nono lacks much personality integrity - much like Luffy. And that doesn't sit well. Her wish from the start, her affiliation with ""Onee-Sama"" and her philosophy changes further down the show are lacking in several ways. Lal'c seems to be more well defined, more well crafted but that is only in comparison to Nono. Otherwise she also develops either too quickly, or conveniently for the plot. This is of course comparing to WELL developed characters. The rest of the characters don't require much attention - most were added for 'plot details' and 'politics' that was again lacking because either it didn't get too much time to develop or it seemed too cliched to appeal. More like a poorly developed cliche which makes it have little to no appeal.
So in the end did I enjoy watching the OVA? No. To fans of the original, watching this is a huge disappointment. To people just watching it for the sake of it, you shouldn't think too hard and enjoy what is going on otherwise you won't really like it.",Negatif
"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is actually minimalistic. At least that's what Diebuster taught me. With TTGL every background and every space is finely tuned to emphasize the actions of the characters, kind of a variation of the Shaft (at least the non stop-mo stuff) style except that its louder and more wild than stylized. The backgrounds in TTGL are always abstract, action lines, explosions and a focus on movement than space. Kill La Kill takes this to an even greater extreme by layering even more Western animation style comic transformations with all the huge letters filling the screen, emphasizing the presence of the characters and
their attacks over delineating a space. The current equivalent would be like comparing Fury Road to an old John Ford or a Western by one of the masters, where in one the desert is subservient to the spectacle (except in some parts of course) where in the other its all about the Desert in all its splendor swallowing the tiny riders while they exchange shootouts with wayward Indians and Bandits. Diebuster is the old Western.
The main character of Diebuster, contrary to what people believe, is neither Lal'C nor Nono, but Space itself. The multiplicity of worlds that the character's inhabit, and the otherworldly denizens within that overwhelms the concept of human and what it means to create a civilization in an excess of empty matter.
It also happens to be a story about a friendship between two girls, but that's another thing. It's kind of the Gainax ability (at least with Tsurumaki and Anno) to make the small struggles of everyday humans reflect the state of the whole cosmos. But that's one of the secret great things about animation, that the worlds crafted are wholly subjective, and thus they HAVE to reflect psychology because its our definition of what makes a world rather than an actual world. Old cinema theorists used to talk about how the objective eye of the camera was aimed at capturing the beauty and naturalism of the world, and maybe a film like Boyhood is our greatest testament to that in current times, but Animation is wholly opposed to that sensibility, and with CGI being so prevalent, movies are turning away from that as well to an idea of pure image (whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is the subject of tons of conversations between various philosophers of media and postmodernity. Can we still live while we continuously reject the Real at every instance? Or maybe its an inherent human thing to warp, restructure and be contrary to Nature).
The bad thing is that no one has ever really conceived of what it means to step outside the cinematic notions of time and space and to have a work of art that lies wholly beyond the space in front of the camera. The greatest animators are harvesters of this sensibility, from Miyazaki to Satoshi Kon to the Gainaxers and the Shaft personnel. Makoto Shinkai even, who, despite being called a realistic artist, edges what is Real to an extreme that somehow pushes past it. Madoka Movie 3 is the farthest I have seen someone go in this attempt at pure Animation, at least outside of strange non-mainstream experimental film stuff. Sakuga, the art of creating motion through Key Animation, is a skill practiced solely at harnessing this sensibility. TTGL will add fury to the lines and thickness to the brush so as to create faces that burn out of the screen and actions that explode into the frame, while keeping all other aspects pretty streamlined.
But while all that is theory, we're here to talk about Tsurumaki and his craft. Sarah Horrocks, a comic book reviewer, talked about how Tsutomu Nihei's greatest strength in Knights of Sidonia was his ability to capture the pure silence of Space, changing his sensibility wholly from his previous cyber-bio-punk actiony works. Tsurumaki knows all of that, the gracefulness of it that has been reflected in great films like 2001 A Space Odyssey and Interstellar. But he also has a plethora of tricks up his sleeve to vary the tempo with high octane space battles, using all of the old missile circus style explosions and tricks. He uses CGI when necessary, and not it an alienating way, but to depict mass and weight. He can draw close quartered distilled emotional spaces like those out of Evangelion no problem as well. From small inhabited spaces to large encroaching Space itself. And he also has a kind of Pinky-Film exploitative sexual sensibility that pushes normal fanservice into a kind of high level pop-camp-aesthetic. This is not the degraded erotic fanservice that punctuates so many shoddily made harem shows, but the type of thing that emphasizes curvature and body-motion and sometimes straight out bare-faced Faster Pussycat Kill Kill Kill clothes-tearing brazen stuff that reflects an underground sensibility that so characterizes Gainax's subversive values in every way (then again Anno came up with all that in the original Gunbuster, so this is just an evolution of that).
The thing is that the original Gunbuster was beautiful at moments, with its noir-space-opera purple shadows and it’s cynical war plot that sort of resembled Joe Halderman’s The Forever War except while trying to stick in all the anime stuff about Truth and Heart and all that. All of it though was really jarring with the melodrama and characterization that Anno hadn’t fine-tuned yet, until it would explode into the oppressive atmosphere of Evangelion. Diebuster really shoves it right out the window by being willing to take the blazing Shounen values all the way while also respecting character and atmosphere. It even pushes the science from the pop-science of time-dilation and all that new quantum physics that was becoming in-vogue at the era, to science that probably completely doesn’t make sense in any way but sounds completely out there. Episode 3 is more or less perfect. And Tsurumaki being a guy that doesn’t care too much about exposition, as compared to Gunbuster at least, at least makes it so that exposition is being carried out with visual stimulation, and uses visual storytelling for the most part.
But really Diebuster is about imbibing the world. It’s a vision the same way Blade Runner was a vision, or that Madoka was a vision, or that Akira was a vision. A large large larger than life vision that seems to want to destroy Reality in every way and shows us that if escapism was this all-encompassing, then it’s completely okay to stake your entire life in a small cramped up apartment making stuff like this one particle at a time over copious copious drawing boards. A work to show that really who the hell needs anything that Life has to offer when our Dreams are so gallant? And you’d pay your whole soul fending off cockroaches and dirty walls and meagre salaries and horrible real life shit just to capture that sort of thing for ephemeral seconds on screen.",Negatif
"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
Diebuster was a disappointment.
I enjoyed Gunbuster very much. It's one of my favorite anime ever. Going into Diebuster, I wasn't sure what to expect, but right from the beginning, something seemed off. I wanted to enjoy this series, but it just didn't appeal to me at all. This series has practically nothing to do with Gunbuster. In fact, I would go as far as to say that this series' story goes directly against the themes of Gunbuster. The only connections to Gunbuster for a majority of the series are just shallow references to the original.
""Hey, remember in episode 2 of Gunbuster when
there was a gratuitous bath scene? Well here's a gratuitous bath scene in episode 2!""
""Hey, remember when Noriko said 'Onee-sama' in Gunbuster? Well Nono does that too!""
I wouldn't even be that bothered by this if not for the fact that this show is so disconnected from the original series that it doesn't even feel like it takes place in the same universe. It feels like these gratuitous references were just attempts to remind people that ""yes, this is a sequel"". Diebuster just feels like some random unrelated show that had Gunbuster references plastered onto it.
Consider this. Gunbuster is a show about a normal girl who saves the world and everyone she loves through hard work, perseverance, bravery, and sacrifice. Diebuster is a show about a robot who was built to save the world and is able to do so because she was built to do so. Doesn't that completely go against what the original series is all about? The reason Nono is able to save the day in the end isn't because of hard work and determination, it's because she just happens to be a buster machine. But then again, the story is so hard to follow that maybe I'm just completely misunderstanding everything.
The animation and visuals in this show are extremely good, mirroring the original series' impressive polish and surpassing it, but the story that these visuals are applied to is just not good, and as a sequel, it's even worse. Gunbuster was exciting and emotional, but I didn't care about any of the characters in Diebuster, except maybe Lal'c. Nono is annoying and none of the other characters really get enough screen time for me to know or care about them. The only things about this show that I can commend are the animation and visual style, which might even be good enough to justify watching the series just to look at them if you're into animation and visual art, but if you're looking for a good story or a good sequel to Gunbuster, this isn't it.",Negatif
"Diebuster serves as a sequel to Gainax’s classic mecha series, Gunbuster, that is set thousands of years following the events of Gunbuster. Focused on a seemingly clutzy teenage girl named Nono, she aspires to become a space pilot and comes to idolize Lal’C Mellk Mal, a girl around Nono’s age who is the pilot of the Buster Machine mecha known as Dix-Neuf. Lal’C is part of the Fraternity, a group of teen mecha pilots called Topless who each have their own Buster Machines used to combat a mysterious space monster threatening humanity’s expansion into space. As Nono interacts with Lal’C and the Fraternity, she comes
to realize some truths about herself that make her realize she isn’t an ordinary girl.
Suppose one thing I should get out of the way with covering Diebuster is the many nods it makes to Gunbuster. Without spoiling too much of Diebuster’s developments, Nono and Lal’C’s characters and their relationship parallel those of Noriko and Kazumi from the original series, while also sporting the same type of mecha to combat the alien threats that threaten Earth. Both titles also carry similar themes and storytelling elements involving coming-of-age and sacrifice in regards to the main conflict of their respective titles.
The results of these Gunbuster nods do have their pros and cons throughout Diebuster. On the one hand, the character dynamics with Nono and Lal’C play out differently from Noriko and Kazumi’s to give the former’s relationship some more uniqueness and create some differing developments with their characters. Plus, there’s a good deal of spectacle in seeing the mecha action as Buster Machines to combat the alien enemy with the fights being nicely animated and having a good deal of visual detail depicted. Nono’s character serves as a fun homage of sorts to old-school mecha anime in Diebuster’s second half when she takes on a more active role to combat the aliens.
Spectacle aside though, Diebuster does have some major issues when it comes to areas of its storytelling. It attempts to have a larger scale to its plot compared to Gunbuster, though this falls flat in a number of areas. The series attempts to dabble into developments befalling a couple of Lal’C’s fellow Topless, but their developments aren’t as engaging to see develop compared to Lal’C and Nono. There are a decent number of plot elements that Diebuster doesn’t dabble too deeply into such as Nono’s origins before being found and why humanity seems prejudiced against the Topless. The second half of the series also becomes a bit hard to follow with the scientific jargon discussed with the alien threat and the rather ambiguous fate of one major character when the conflict is resolved. In short, Diebuster’s storytelling didn’t feel as cohesive compared to Gunbuster as it seemed to be doing a bit too much at a number of points within its 6-episode runtime.
If you can look past Diebuster’s storytelling issues, it still retains the over-the-top spectacle of mecha action and charming character chemistry of its two female leads found from Gunbuster. Mecha fans just wanting to see this for the action spectacle and Gainax’s signature fan service should still get a treat out of Diebuster in spite of its faults.",Negatif
"Long story short: Another series with amazing animation, action, and visual design tainted by Gainax being Gainax. This series would be a solid 8 or even a 9, but the bare-bones plot, mostly forgettable characters, absurd plethora of fanservice and uncomfortable exploitation of the female lead leave a sour taste in your mouth. Otherwise this could have been the best thing Gainax ever did. In some ways it's much better than Gunbuster but in others even more frustrating.
--------------
Story: As I said, it's pretty bare plot. Nono wants to become a space pilot because her hero was one. She meets Lal'C, a ""Topless"" who has a
psychic connection to a Buster Machine, and immediately forms a bond with her for reasons that are somewhat lost on me. The rest of the series is mainly a bunch of teenagers who are mankind's only hope fighting Space Monsters in giant robots, combined with a lot of subplots and scenes that feel like nonsequiturs because they go nowhere. There's a pretty interesting plot twist in Episode 4 that they could have based the entire story around, but they don't really do anything with it, and the resolution of Nono's character arc is both a huge Deus Ex Machina and a pretty forced reference to the original series.
However, there is one intensely uncomfortable scene in Episode 5 which, after all of the shenanigans that came before, nearly breaks the camel's back in regards to the plot, and yet it's completely dropped after a few minutes. It bears mentioning because it's completely unnecessary, much like Coach's treatment of Onee-sama in Gunbuster Episode 5, but somehow even worse in terms of how it's handled. 6/10
Art: My god, my god, this is peak Gainax animation. Gunbuster was a great looking series for its time that also had major budget issues near the end - not to mention that the last two episodes of that series were completely unplanned at the beginning. By contrast Gainax pulled out all the stops for Diebuster. I've seen some people complain about the piloting outfits and how the FLCL-esque art design is less appealing to them than Gainax's other series, but I really like it because despite how goofy it looks it adds some visual character that Gunbuster lacked. And even compared to End of Evangelion the animation is unparalleled to the rest of Gainax's work. If there is a single saving grace to this series, it is the animation quality and the action sequences. 9/10
Sound: The best part of the sound design in Diebuster is definitely the soundtrack, as well as the OP and ED. Both the OP and ED are really enjoyable and add an upbeat tone to the series that it really needs to keep from being bogged down in melodrama. I've seen some critique of those compared to Gunbuster but I enjoy the funky 2000s J-Pop tone more than the 80s cheese of Gunbuster, as fun as it is. The orchestral score is also very good, if somewhat unmemorable compared to other Gainax scores. The references they make in the score to that of Gunbuster are also a lot more subtle and feel a lot less pandering than many of the more direct references they make in other ways. 8/10
Character: Everything else aside, this is probably the weakest aspect of the series. Nono is... somehow even more one-dimensional than Noriko. She's constantly upbeat and peppy, and so absent-minded and dumb most of the time that you seriously question whether she has the mental capacity of a child, which is entirely possible considering what we find out about her at the end of the first episode. What makes that uncomfortable is how *constantly* sexualized and ogled Nono is because she's admittedly really physically attractive, despite her simple-mindedness. Through the first few episodes she's treated as both the buttmonkey for slapstick gags and also a walking sex object who is constantly ogled by both the camera and her male teammates. I'll come back to this in the ""Enjoyment"" section, but the fanservice and her sexualization in general constantly pull you out from the enjoyment of the series. Not to mention her sudden character development in Episode 4 is jarring and her total change in personality doesn't seem to make any logical sense. With Noriko you can follow her character development, and Simon in TTGL is, for all his annoyance as a character early on, developed quite well. Nono by contrast does not have a ""middle"" to her development - only a ""beginning"" and ""end.""
Lal'C is an OK character in the sense that she probably should have had a lot more focus and even been the MC since Nono really turns out to be more of a plot device than anything. We don't know too much about her and her development is basically becoming more confident in herself and more independent, and also growing closer to Nono for some reason that's not really developed enough. Her relationship with Nicola is also barely touched on and doesn't quite fit with the rest of her character development, especially when you consider *that scene* in Episode 5 where she not only reveals how obsessed she apparently has been with Nicola, but also how warped her relationship with Nono is. It doesn't fit in at all and it's really uncomfortable.
The rest of the characters get at most a single episode of development - Tycho gets a very, very NGE-esque Episode 3 to cover her backstory and dislike of Nono, which is resolved at the end. She never gets any significant character moments after that. Nicola doesn't even get that - he gets like two scenes early in the series, and then that horrifying scene in Episode 5 which makes him utterly unredeemable and is not earned because we barely know the guy, not that it would fix that part at all. Gunbuster spent even less time on its side characters but that wasn't too big of a deal because they essentially did not matter. Here they really want you to care about the whole cast and they don't develop the two leads enough to make up for the poor characterization of the side characters. 5/10
Enjoyment: Let's get this out of the way - once again, the action is incredible and gorgeous. That's kind of a given for a Gainax mecha series but imo the action here is even better than the best parts of Gurren Lagann. All of the high ratings on this series are essentially all due to this.
However, the fanservice and sexual content in general is handled about as clumsily as any Gainax series, including their ecchi series. I want to briefly discuss this because a lot of people will say ""YOU JUST HATE FANSERVICE"" and that's not true in the sense that 9 times out of 10, it does not bother me much. But it's worth comparing the way Diebuster handles sexual content compared to three other somewhat related works: Royal Space Force: Wings of Honneamise; Gunbuster; and Kill la Kill.
In Gunbuster, as alluded to before, the fanservice is there, but it's almost comedic and relegated to scenes like those in the shared bath, aside from the famous moment at the end which is not really necessary but not really that bad. For the most part, you can laugh at it. Kill la Kill was created by many Gainax veterans who worked on Diebuster too, but the sexual content is directly part of the story and themes, and again, is so ludicrous that it passes beyond fanservice into comedy and almost satire.
In Diebuster, the first few episodes are filled with almost *constant* ogling of Nono from both the camera and the male characters. It's even more awkward because Nono is so oblivious that again, it almost feels like she has the maturity of a kid. It's so ridiculously unnecessary that it feels like they weren't confidant that younger otaku who didn't grow up with Gunbuster would enjoy this series without copious reminders that tits and asses exist. Even Lal'C is not exempt because right at the *climax of the series* there is a brief scene which is completely unnecessary yet apparently warrants full nudity.
If you want T&A in your mecha show - make it about that! Why does it need to be sprinkled in everywhere, yet they try to ignore that it's there? And again, there's that scene in Episode 5 which is just the worst example of Gainax inserting intensely uncomfortable scenes which are not necessary at all and are completely glossed over after a few minutes. There's a similar scene all the way in their first major work, Royal Space Force: Wings of Honneamise, which in some ways is worse because you're supposed to feel bad FOR THE GUY because ""oh gee wiz I sure feel bad for doing that,"" and yet at least Gainax doesn't try to ignore that it happened. In Diebuster it involves a character we barely know and aside from the intensely uncomfortable reaction Lal'C has, it basically affects nothing else in the story aside creating a rift between Nono and Lal'C.
I spend so much time on this because it's so common of a problem in classic Gainax works and yet if it's not ignored by their fans, it's dismissed as a problem at all. Without those aspects this series would be one long joyride, but with it you are constantly pulled out from fully enjoying what's going on. 7/10
Overall: I fluctuate between a 6 and a 7 on this one because it's got some incredible aspects that are marred by: really sloppy execution of the story and character elements around the action; somewhat forced callbacks to Gunbuster that don't really come from anywhere; and the weird, exploitative fanservice treatment of Nono in particular and to a lesser extent Lal'C. I'm rather glad that the last few years of the Gainax glory days were led by Imaishi and the team that would create Studio Trigger because it seems they had a much, much better handle on how to manage these aspects than Anno and previous Gainax creative leads had. 7/10",Negatif
"It failed as a sequel to a failure... that some talent.
Joke aside it's really bad, on the same level as the original Gunbuster but unlike the original, it's not even so bad it's good, it's just bad.
But well let's be positive for an instant where does it work:
- the main character Nono she is likable and fun, cliché without a doubt but it works well nonetheless. She can be a little annoying in the latter part of the show but it's okay. And a way better MC than the original Gunbuster.
- the art isn't bad and some parts like space monster and environments look quite
good, the CG also well handles.
Well, that's it for the good part, now where does it fail.
First, as a sequel, it got nothing to do with the original save for some names and locations. The original Gunbuster, while it could be a little silly at times, had overall a rather serious military tone which totally disappears in the sequel with silly robots, silly hats, even more broken physic. The tone is way closer to Gurren Lagann which isn't a problem in itself but breaks the continuity between the 2 ""seasons"".
And if that was all it wouldn't be much of a problem, but everything else is broken the story goes nowhere, and just end with a big monster appearing out of nowhere because of one of the most stupid logic. The characters are, like in the original, paper-thin but here they're even more forgettable and half the time their actions make no sense. Worst of all the world-building one of the aspects where the original wasn't all that bad is here ridiculous, basically, every deus ex machina now works thanks to magic instead of techno bs but aside from that nothing has really changed in 12000 years.
Also one of my let down with the original was that it ends when it was becoming interesting aka when it would have shown how humanity as developed and how the MC legend has developed... well now I know that I would have preferred to never know.
And maybe the biggest drawback: it doesn’t take itself seriously which means that unlike the original it's not even funny.
So to conclude Die buster is bad, don't waste your time. If you like the original you will likely be disappointed by the lack of ""respect"" and even if, like me, you didn't like the original you will also likely be disappointed by how unfunny it's.",Negatif
"There are two words that best describe my thoughts of Utawarerumono that not too many folks would like me to utter: otaku bait. I know this would seem kind of shallow-minded to anyone that may like this series. But considering mostly every prominent character in this series has some sort of animal ears and tail plus look ridiculously cute or physically attractive (along with this anime being an eroge strategy game adaptation), I rest my case with these two words being uttered.
For the most part, Utawarerumono's characters and plot developments are pretty formulaic and straight-forward. The series runs into several arcs with Hakuoro and his
allies running into some hostile enemy threat trying to either halt his revolt or take over his kingdom, Hakuoro coming up with a clever plan to halt said threat, gaining new allies from offing said threat and then a breather episode with comedy highlights coming from the quirks of the characters or everyday scenes with Hakuoro, Eruru and Aruru. While the first arc was okay with Hakuoro leading the commoners to revolt against their corrupt glutton of a ruler, the later arcs do get monotonous with their developments with every country in sight seemingly wanting a piece of Hakuoro and his kingdom for shallow reasons.
Character development with new characters in these arcs is limited to their appearances in said arcs and once they become one of Hakuoro's allies, their roles become mostly downplayed to being loyal soldiers to Hakuoro when they participate in a battle. Other than Hakuoro and a few major characters, you don't get to see too many developments with these ass-kicking characters after they become one of his comrades, which is kind of a shame as a couple of them had their interesting traits and backgrounds during their debut arcs, mainly Oboro and Touka. A number of the major villains confronted in these arcs are so over-the-top and ridiculous with their appearance, behavior and/or mannerisms that they are laughable, especially Hauenkua who reminds me enough of how nuts Escaflowne's Dilandau was.
The other prominent focus of the series is on Hakuoro's mysterious past which the series drops hints of in the not-so-entertaining later arcs of the show. Amnesiac hero storylines normally have a good amount of potential in unveiling some interesting developments for said main hero and a show's plot. But while Hakuoro's character is an interesting and likeable one, what I come to learn of his origins and background comes across as quite a big contradiction to the type of world Utawarerumono had set up throughout its run.
Visually, the series does sport good looking scenery and characters (despite the latter's clear ""appeal"") with vivid colors and a decent amount of detail applied to them. The show's animation is average at many points with occasional use of shortcuts and some bad use of CG animation in the rendering of armies during battle scenes.
While I did get some enjoyment out of seeing Hakuoro and some other characters in their struggles throughout Utawarerumono, the show's cliched plot setup, weak focus on other prominent characters and ridiculous reveal on Hakuoro's origins greatly weakened the quality of the series in my eyes. This is a good example of why I'm cautious with approaching anime adaptations of eroge games as the quality of said title tends to vary and usually won't translate too well when made into an anime.",Negatif
"I think this anime was just poorly executed.
The overall story is actually good and interesting, at the beginning and again at the end, it was just buried under piles of nonsense and extremely forgettable characters. The story follows Hakuoro, who after being found and rescued by a small village he becomes the leader of a rebellion, emperor of a country and then spends his time fight wars with every other country around.
A major plot twist happens near the end that was so unexpected and weird that my initial reaction was ""I am just going to pretend that didn't happen...""and even when it gets explained
in the end and you no longer have to pretend it didn't happen, I was still thinking, ""it could have been better.""
Because there were so many ""mini-wars"" they all ultimately blended together because they weren't very memorable. Characters were introduced and I had high hopes for what their future actions would be and how they would affect the plot but then the plot would change because of a different war in a different country and then those expectations just crumble into dust. There are some parts of this series that are completely boring as sin.
The character designs are pretty enough, but this series, which is based on war, didn't have any memorable fight scenes of bad-assery. Seriously, even with the flat characters this would be more entertaining to watch if the characters at least could kick some ass in awesome fights. But the fights were boring and predictable. On the other hand, the characters being completely flat doesn't help. It's hard to get excited about a fight if you simply don't care whether or not a character dies.
I always believed that good, well developed characters can carry a plot no matter how contrived it is, but in this case the characters are so bad, you're just sitting there thinking ""Who cares?""
Honestly, I really liked the opening song for this anime, so it was my favourite part of watching.",Negatif
"If you are a fan of shonen anime like One Piece and Bleach that boil your blood, fan of innovative anime like Monster, Hunter X Hunter that makes you appreciate the time you spent, mystery like Full Metal Alchemist that drives you crazy, humor like Gintama that will make you rofl, THIS ANIME IS NOT FOR YOU.
This is one of the most overrated animes I have come across. Anyone that seriously has a passion for action/adventure anime will be fooled and disappointed with the ratings and genre.
Concept: 8/10
If there is anything good about this anime, it is the concept of the plot.
The story briefly is about an injured man with a wierd mask that is saved by the people of a small village, that man suffers with amnesia and that village quickly becomes his home. Because of his wisdom and kindness, he quickly becomes the leader and then his forgotten past begins to haunt him. The anime involves many war sequences, some strategies involved, loyalties, betrayals and violence. Sounds like a good concept for a action/adventure lover.
Enjoyment/Characters: 5/10
The director of the anime did come up with a good concept, but failed miserably in translating a good concept to enjoyment. I thought the potential of a very good concept was totally wasted.
The main character in the anime suits perfectly for this kind of story, the major problem is some of the characters that surround him. There is very little character development and everyone else just pops out of the blue, you will know very little about every major character of the anime by the time you finish.
The plot is purely for simpleminded people, trust me, there is NOTHING genius about this anime. It had little to no twists and turns in the plot, everything seemed predictable. There are NO scenes where you will be amazed, there are NO scenes where you will get fired up. The whole concept of war is made a joke.
There is no humor in the anime, some will say there is some, but that is for simpleminded ones. There is absolutely NO humor in the anime and the very little efforts of humor add to the problems.
Be prepared for some very annoying characters that are sadly major characters in the anime, a female girl named Eruru and her little sister Aruru. The main character of the series (Hakuoro) is looked upon as father by the little sister Aruru while the older sister Eruru loves him. In one of the middle episodes of the anime, Hakuoro tells  publicly that Eruru is like his sister, yet Eruru continues to love him. There is excessive romance between Hakuoro and Eruru, by romance I mean situations that involve Eruru showing her love, but Hakuoro showing indifference to her love. I personally could not take a pseudo incest relationship, every episode will have some.
Then you have moronic scenes that do not make any sense. Eruru and Aruru care a lot about Hakuoro and will insist on accompanying him to the wars and he agrees. I am talking about roughly a 17 year old girl with no fighting skills that wants to stay close to her lover at any cost and a 8 year old girl that just does not want to stay away from her dad even for few hours. They both accompany him to wars where there is massive killing happening around them, hardcore I mean. These kind of situations will make you feel ""I could have done a better job directing this"".
The art was good for the most part, but the fight sequences could have been better.
By end of the day I did not learn anything from this anime, dropped watching a couple of times in middle and still picked up because I had nothing else to watch, ultimately repented for the time I invested.",Negatif
"In Utawarerumono, there are two gods that fight for eternity. This explanation as an answer to the mystery that surrounds the anime until about a half is somewhat disappointing, in my opinion. E gives rise to a final ultra-romantic, and so very unpleasant.
However, the idea made me reflect. It was another anime that I felt sick to finish. Not as much as X, but almost. It's a sad ending (after all, it's ultra-romantic), in which many are hit and confirms that a destination of suffering for one of the main characters. Something forceful means to an anime that will gradually captivating, at least until the
middle of the plot. Once captivated, feel more impacts with those fictitious persons.
The reflection reminded me a bit of Nietzsche, the Greek philosophers of antiquity and also Milan Kundera, in his novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being A concept I never studied law: the eternal return.
The idea that I could infer the eternal return, which may be distorted with respect to the above references conceived, but I built up here has the following premise: we carry our past. The drama of Hakuoro, the anime, is precisely that of not remembering his past, not knowing what he carries. A drama that becomes more painful to the extent that he suspects not to remember his past. But how to get rid of it?
How Karura says, ""it is impossible to completely disconnect from the past."" As it becomes worse for a god who returns to experience several lives forever? The hidden horror of the anime Utawarerumono is something that resembles the curse of Dracula in Bram Stoker's novel. It is the inescapable destiny to live forever, forever come back to life.
Milan Kundera says in his most famous novel by celebrated and that is the French Revolution, for example, how would react if we were to repeat it forever, always cutting heads, an eternal return? What would be the weight of it? Einmal ist keinmal, says the German adage (""once is never""). There is a mystique around binarity, and very curious. It is as if there were only two numbers, where one equals zero, and the rest reaches infinity. The light would live once, only once, so that the experience would equal to nothing, perhaps because it is something finite in an infinite time. Interestingly, I remember having spoken about equality of existence and nonexistence. I ended up dropping it again somehow. The heavy, in turn, would live forever, forever returning to live. Again, I remember having mentioned the question of ""whether or not a story to an end."" The target heavy does not give us that chance.
In Utawarerumono, does not explain how these gods were born. They may have arisen from mere humans. It is possible that they, the gods are nothing but ourselves. It is possible that we humans, for which accumulate more knowledge, nothing more than able to awaken the consciousness of the eternal return which we are stuck.
If it's terrible for a man found in the woods, injured, not remembering his days until then, how terrible it would be for us to be in the same situation? Assuming then that there is something like an afterlife, or something that brings us back to an experience ... how terrible it would be to ignore the past that pervaded by several lifetimes? Worse, how terrible would not realize that we are beginning to remember that?
Although the chance of revival can not be disputed, we need not go that far. Simply we exchange of god. Just think that the god in question is not a human being, but humanity itself. As a member of humanity, can we, each of us, off the streets, watching the sky, hit the ground and even see how we treat each other and still say that what others have done before us has nothing to see us?
Assume then that humanity is the god who is destined to fight with himself, guiding other beings with their power. God attached to the eternal return. Coincidence or not, Hakuoro is the only fully human person, ie, does not have ears or tails of animals like all other characters. The difference is that Hakuoro has a mask that can not get out. The question is if that mask is the hallmark of the link between apes and humans or whether technological remnant of an advanced civilization that perished - we do not have the answer to the curse which it represents (not sure if Benawi also not human, what would the only odd exception, as I remember). When this god despair, crushed by his fate, would be annihilated. But not even the black winged angel, created by him, Mutsumi, can do it.
Assuming then that we, all of us, this god. What do you think? It is a god that is divided in two because it indulges in his wrath, and will pay for this act forever as the eternal return will bring back the anger. Every act is heavy. Every mistake is perpetual.
I must confess I underestimated Parmenides. He said that in his philosophy that everything was very complicated being, that motion, time and change were illusions, also said that everything was binary. And in all groups associated dichotomies associated with the good and the bad. The pair light-heavy, so if associated respectively to the good-bad. I have always considered him a reluctant to accept the flow of things, like his contemporary Heraclitus said, today I must admit that he was more intelligent than I supposed.
What shall we do with our mistakes? What shall we do with the sins of mankind? What awaits us?
If everything was light ... live with ease. Eruru not carry the suffering that comes from the Mikoto, Hakuoro could live without mask. Bastaríamos live with and hope our story will end. So would fly over our destinies. And we would be so light and so scattered, like cirrus clouds. Our existence is no more than an imperceptible and tremendously ephemeral blur, a flash of blink of an eye.
I have overcome the terror that comes over us when we first understand what it is to live once. But assuming the truth involving one of only two numbers of binarity existential, which would be more terrible? Living or once living forever? We would have to live only by our successes, that should sparkle on any errors that surely commit more frequently. What is harder then? Isolate themselves, cling to faint and rare warmth amid the eternal darkness and always retornantes or bet everything on one chance to live a simple and final time?",Negatif
"Studio OLM that brought the world Berserk and Pokemon in the late 90’s now brings an anime in 2006 that can best be described as anime-nerd-bait aka otaku bait. Together with new director Tomoki Kobayashi (Galaxy Angel Z) they attempted to adapt this eroge strategy game. At first, the product of Utawarerumono started off with an interesting high fantasy with semi-interesting characters and then takes a left-turn along the way.
The show begins with a cute wolf-type girl finding an injured man in the woods wearing a mask he cannot remove. She and her family nurse him back to health, but the man still does not
have any memories of his past. Slowly, the audience learns the land, society, and the slow progression to war with strategic battle ensuing.
Mostly, Utawarerumono is formulaic in the characters with typical trope characters such as the quiet adorable little sister character. Even the plot is fairly simple from the start with oppressed people fighting back against the tyrants. Over the course of the anime there is little in character development and more towards the main group gathering other character arch-types to join the team. Basically, this anime wanted to be what The Vision of Escaflowne was. This was a show with a compelling premise that pretty much fails in its goal.
At one point, the people behind Utawarerumono decided to drop the story they were telling for almost zero reason like something anime fans had seen in something out of Votoms in the 80s as an example. Unlike Votoms though, the characters in Utawarerumono have the personality of either a stone or a carebear. Even the character art and animation does not seem much better than Studio OLM’s past works like Berserk and Pokemon from the 90’s.
This is not to say the show is completely terrible. Some scenes of battles and the fantasy world are interesting, but ultimately with predictable characters and a plot that is shallow, the show is just flat. There are plenty of other fantasy shows to recommend like The Vision of Escalflowne over this anime. In the end Utawarerumono should stay as an eroge game and was not a good adaptation.",Negatif
"I created an account on this site just because someone listed this anime as a recommended one for Berserk lovers, and I'm here to set the record straight. This anime is a feeble minded kids anime that takes every anime cliche and throws it into one series. Go ahead, read the other reviews and you'll see they mention the run of the mill story, and standard anime characteristics. This review will let you know how dumb this anime is. No plot spoilers, but a preview of some crap to come.
First you start off with a man who wakes from a coma. So you're thinking
cool, now we have to find out who this guy is and why he's wearing that mysterious mask. Then we find out he's in a feudal time period. All of a sudden there are elf like people and people with cat ears. Ok WAIT!!! now they all ride on dinosaurs?!?!!? Then the protagonist befriends a couple of angels? Now they jumped from fighting bows and arrows to giant mech like robots? Finally the writers say, JUST KIDDING and hit you with a bunch of Sci-Fi BS and now we know why he wears the mask and.....no one cares. EPIC FAIL
This anime is clearly a children's anime. Whoever recommended this to Berserk fans should be shot in the face. The characters are flat. To have a ""deep"" character there must be conflict within the character, these characters are the same from start to finish. Some reviews say there is something in this anime that everyone could like, and it's true because this anime THREW EVERYTHING INTO ONE STORY AND TRIED TO MAKE YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. I only finished the anime hoping to find some redeeming attribute but as other reviews say the ending let them down. The whole series will let you down.
I felt it was necessary to create an account on this site and inform people about how truly horrible this anime is. Maybe my expectations are skewed because I only watch good anime filtered through word of mouth, so if you like watching horrible anime to have a greater appreciation of the animes that are truly great, then this is a must see. If you don't want to soil your eyes and mind and stick to just watching good anime, then definitely skip this one.",Negatif
"This is a show I really enjoyed when it was airing... But I later realized It I didn't retain those feelings.
First of all the story is really fun to get into. The setting is a land resembling feudal Japan. So it provokes a cool cultural feeling when it's watched.
The character are good, some are cute others are just cool. But it's a shame the show doesn't focus on them heavilly (but apparently the original game does). So yeah the character focus is a bit off and thats sad.
The fighting is alright. But nothing special. It's not fast (with some exceptions) but it's well coordinated.
And most of the time it's not like the single animation still action shots (most of the fighting is REALLY animated haha)
Story is fun. But it's very slow. I didn't realize this at first. But the pacing is very bad. The developments are fun to watch. Especially as the cast becomes bigger.
Sound isn't much of a issue. Sword clanging is heard alot but it's not annoying.
For Enjoyment. I would say it's enjoyable. But you won't want to rewatch it.
Overall. Give it a watch if you want a nice feudal war anime.

"I think I liked this show?  I will explain my thoughts a bit, but there are slight spoilers so I'll put some spaces before I begin.
*SPOILERS*
So the show starts off as a fairly average fantasy show and the main character drives technological and tactical development in a medieval world.  It is nothing special, but enjoyable.  However, halfway or more through, the show goes in a completely different direction.  At first it seems like they've got gundams, but then you realize that they're more like the machines from Neon Genesis Evangelion.  The plot suddenly gets very confusing and the show does
a poor job explaining what happens.  They touch on human experimentation, reincarnation, sateliite lases, and divinities.
The main character has gathered his allies, which include a few good characters, but when they bring in the mobile suits, those characters are basically useless.  All the character development of his allies is essentially wasted.  It was like the first half and second half were done by completely different people.
The show has no idea what it wants to be and the viewer has the experience of a fantasy show suddenly changed in direction that was never foreshadowed in the early parts.  It was like if an author wrote an entire book with no magic and no hints of magic, then the ending was solved by the main character with, ""oh yeah I can do magic."" (This is my example of an idea, not what happens in the show.)  When you set up the rules for a fictional world, the author needs to obey those rules, and if they want to change things then foreshadowing is necessary.
It's tough to pin down my feelings on everything because I really liked a few of th characters, but in my opinion the show really went off the rails.  Too much is unexplained to the viewer.  It is also difficult to figure out what the target audience is, the beginning and ending are just so different.  I took a little while to stew before writing this review, because honestly, I felt a bit mad after the show ended.  This was a decent universe that was squandered.",Negatif
"Utawarerumono is a decent fantasy anime which although light on plot surprises does take an unexpected direction early in the series.
The story centres around Hakuowlo a man discovered badly injured in the woods with a mask on his face and no memory of who he is and how he got where he is. When he recovers from his wounds his leadership skills become apparent enabling him to lead those around him as events unfold through the story and persuading former enemies and vaious other waifs and strays to join his group.
Visually Utawarerumono is very pleasing with very good character design where the fantasy of the
story is enhanced as the characters, with the exception of Hakuwlo, have animal ears and tails or wings. I wouldn't say any of the characters were spectacular individually but individually they all added something to the story.
For about 20 episodes I really enjoyed the show with battle scenes and lots of action but then it started to get all trippy. Almost as if the creators rolled up a joint or took something else illegal because all of a sudden we get a modern or futuristic laboratory scenes, fantasy mecha robots and monsters.
Personally I felt the laboratory scenes, robots and monsters were unnecessary and kind of ruined the end of the story. The last episode is really an attempt to salvage a decent ending which was done to a certain extent but a lot of damage was done already which was a big shame as if they kept it more simple the ending would have been much better.
All in all a very good anime ruined by the bizarre end to the story.",Negatif
"✪ Genre: action (swordplay), drama, high fantasy, military, seinen with elements of superpower
✔Positive Aspects✔
◧ Animation: distinct character designs and beautiful landscapes animated in colors of medium saturation and vibrancy. It isn't that bad even though it has a mid-'90s feel to it.
◧ Soundtrack: decent work, mostly comprised of new age, Japanese folk music, and the occasional orchestral, film score-like tracks, usually embellishing the action sequences.
✘Negative Aspects✘
◧ Concept: it's very rare for a high fantasy anime to be conceptually uninteresting, but this series somehow managed it. Usually, high fantasy series tend to gradually explain all aspects of their fictional worlds, natural and social, since they cannot
share, by definition, any aspects of our non-fictional world. This series, from start to finish, went on as if nothing at all needed an explanation, neither the animal-like/angel-like human beings(?) populating this fictional world, nor how it is structured, socially speaking.
◧ Character development: even though the series is fairly balanced with regard to its dramatic parts and action sequences, it squandered most of its dramatic airtime on portraying the characters engaging on menial tasks, instead of actually displaying their thoughts, their motivations, and their beliefs. It made the task of sympathizing with the characters exceedingly difficult because the viewer had no idea who these characters actually were, even the protagonists themselves.
1st  example: the series has been hinting. begrudgingly. at some kind of specialness on the part of Hakuoro, but does not establish until the 23rd episode.
2nd example: the series has been hinting, unsatisfactorily, at some main antagonist, but does not establish until the 24th episode.
◧ Plot: in this series, the absence of a central plot is a glaring issue. It is not as if it was comprised of multiple subplots that were, eventually, going to lead into the central plot. The entire series is, essentially, structured around 5-6 episodes-long plotlines, usually revolving around the latest military threat, whose leadership's motivations are conspicuously inadequate, and at times comically so, for large-scale warfare.
◧ Action scenes: they tended to escalate and finish up quickly, even for a seinen military action series, and while they were decently bloody, that did not make much of a difference.
Overall: A substandard series all around that wasted all of its technically average airtime without a main antagonist, without explaining fundamental aspects of its fictional world, and without building up its characters, usually, past 4-5 episodes from their first appearances.",Negatif
"I've heard how good the Utawarerumono VAs are, but that the first one wasn't ever translated into English (at least, not through legitimate outlets)--but no worries, there's an anime for that! It's not great to feel like you have to watch an anime just to get to the VAs--makes it feel like homework rather than fun series watching--but as far as homework goes, this went down pretty smoothly.
This is about 30% typical anime harem shit (something I have very little patience for these days), 50% political maneuvering (eg, strategy and battles), and 20% sci-f oddities. I'm not usually a politics/strategy kind of guy, but the
pacing of Utawarerumono makes it more digestible than most series. It also helps the 26 episodes go by quicker than I would have anticipated. It's always churning out new little mini-arcs; if you don't like the current direction, don't worry, it'll just be a couple of episodes before we're on to newer things.
But the harem stuff is pretty cringe-worthy. Sure, I find the protagonist to be pretty bland--not a bad guy, but lacking an engaging personality (which is probably a result of the VA roots)--but it's more about the way the series rushes all these females into his group. Some call him father (ew), some call him master (ew, ew), but whatever they call him, they're all devoted and ready to lay down their life. Throw in an implied incest element, a touch of loli, and there's just... oof. A lot going on here, much of which I am not the target demographic for.
Maybe the series' ability to be a little of everything is a part of its appeal. Because even as I was disinclined towards the ecchi, I really liked the sci-fi stuff that cropped up in the last five or six episodes. Would I recommend it for the sci-fi? Maybe not. But it really strengthened the series, giving it deeper layers than it had been pretending previously.",Negatif
"I stumble upon this anime after attracted to the old-medievil-fantasy genre. Since it got high score from MAL, i decided to give a shot at this.
Unfortunately, after watching almost half of this series, i can conclude that this story is extremely, overly, overrated. This anime is extremely not interesting. I wonder why it got such high rating. Most probably due to the nostalgia..
This anime got almost all characteristics that any weak/terrible anime have.
1. Stupid story that make no sense with no background whatsoever plus with stupid, weak story-telling. extremely fast paced, skipping time frame, plus nothing about the world of this anime is explained.
All these
makes me feel everything about this anime is dumb and stupid.
2. Stupid, annoying, typical trope of characters with weak seiyuu.
3. Inconsistent and terrible animation.

"One day this mysterious man appeared inside of the village.  Collapsed on the cold ground, a family decides to take him in. Certain events entail and he becomes the leader of the village after tragic events occur.  Because of the main character's sound advise, people begin to trust him and follow in his reign. Warring occurs using normal swords and polearms, etc.
I am really enjoying this anime by now.
And then something happens. Supernaturally powerful characters appear who are attributed with devastating strength.  Hmm that's odd, but okay I guess that acceptable ( since the folk here ride raptors instead of horses ),
this isn't too far out of the ordinary.  Then the story line begins to add new enemies into the plot without explaining their background.  Furthermore, it appears like the enemies are slowly adding to the story line, until they are miraculously eliminated while leaving the viewer with far too many questions.
Now I am confused, but thinking that the anime will jump back to its original story line and we can finish this safe and sound.
Suddenly, ROBOTS appear.  Holy cow! I mean, how does a world living in the medieval era harness robots to do their bidding. Great, okay. Let me just get through these episodes now. Oh wait, the robots are easily slaughtering everything and everybody? We have a weapon to destroy them? Sure, just slash them a few times and they begin to bleed.
My patience for this anime has now left the building.  Luckily, the main character has this tremendous special ability to save the world.

"I have no intentions of denying this series the spiel it gets, since it manages to do the one thing any ambitious anime should do well: characters. More that that, this series concentrates on its cast, looking closely into it, and tracking its experience of the ruthless times and situations they're thrown into.
And that is very good. Some may see what I'll say next as nitpicking, and I admit that this kind of anime is not my cup of tea, but here goes. Although the characters, or rather showing how they're influenced by the current tragedy is done very well, there certainly are flaws to
this anime. The story itself at the beginning is not logical enough for anime that concentrates on times of war. There is a lot of brutality and blood, and most of the villains are lunatics doing their best to piss audience off to maximize satisfaction it gets from watching them being mashed into bloody puddle of gore. And when Team MC starts faring a bit too well, there are magical giant robot combat exoskeletons introduced to scar the heroes better.
If you enjoy that, well, that anime's for you.
One more thing. While art and sound were, well, sufficient at least, I simply have to say this: OP is, for reasons, a horrendous bastard born from union between blues, anime trash music, and softcore porn background soundtrack, completely killing any and all tension pre-OP scene might've built up. I recommend skipping, should you opt to give this series a go.",Negatif
"Ever imagined being someone else? That idea may have come across your mind sometime in your life. No really, I’m sure almost everyone at least had that thought once in their lifetime. So what happens when there’s a case of body swapping and you become a person of the opposite gender? I think that would be very peculiar experience. Yamada-kun to 7-in no Majo (Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches) operates under circumstances where two main characters changes their bodies and well, you can guess from here that all sort of drama comes rolling.
The series is adapted from the manga of the same name that runs
for over 160+ chapters and is still ongoing. Directed by Takuno Seiki, the show is a hit or miss. The hit part could be the comedy as the show really likes to play around a lot with itself. That’s because the body switching gimmick isn’t the only concept explored in this series. If you read the title, you’ll notice the word, “witches”. In a nutshell, there should be expectations that other sorts of magical or supernatural phenomenon will propel itself into the story. And that’s not an understatement. The miss part would be the storytelling. Before the series debuted, it was announced that the series would only be adapted into a 1 cour span of (12 episodes). It’s not a split cour, not a 2 cour, and definitely not a good piece of news to remember in mind.
Make no mistake. The series takes off pretty quick as the pilot episode establishes the body switching gimmick quickly without wasting time. No more than 10 minutes into the series and you’ll see a guy (Yamada) staring into the mirror and realizes that he no longer has “it”. On the other hand, there’s the smart and beautiful Uraha Shiraishi who is now in the body of a delinquent. This all happened by a coincidental event when they landed on each other off a flight of stairs. While this all seems troublesome, they do discover that reversing the effect involves a kiss. This also revives the Supernatural Studies Club, a group of students dedicated in studying supernatural phenomenon. By this point, I think you can get adjusted to the idea of the show. It’s one of those series that really likes to play around with itself from the very beginning. In fact, almost every episode features some sort of unusual circumstance that ends up causing a lot of drama for the main characters.
As a club composed of several members, the series gives the audience some insight on them. The titular character Ryu Yamada is easily noticeable for his delinquent-like traits and personality. Throughout the series, we see him as guy that uses his fist to do the talking although he does care quite a lot about his friends. Uraha is more of a polar opposite. Smart, beautiful, and stoic in a way, she often keeps to herself and is often thinks before she acts. The way the show formulates their relationship at first almost feels like it’s on auto-pilot. Since neither character are similar, they have to learn more about each other. In the story, we see how that progresses with each episode. Unfortunately, I can’t say that their relationship is really believable. While some series can easily capture the audience’s attention with polar opposite characters, this one just ticks a bit way too much with the comedy. Not to mention, we have the kissing part that is used as a plot device. The romance aspect of it feels forced and quickly rushed without developing much for our characters. However, I do have to say that the chemistry between Yamada and Uraha can be surprisingly charming. There’s a genuine mutual respect and feeling the two share as we can easily see that later on in the show. As for the other characters, we have Toranosuke Miyamura who serves more as a middleman, Miyabi Ito with her fascination of supernatural phenomenon, and Kentaro Tsubaki who happens to have a crush on Uraha. While not as prominent as Yamada and Uraha, they do play some key roles in the series. Unfortunately, some of them can be easily forgettable after first impressions.
Then, there are the witches. There’s seven of them including Uraha. The series early on establishes the fact that all of them have a different power. We don’t know most of their powers or how they work until the witches reveal themselves. And as a 1 cour series, the show tries to seize every opportunity to capture that point. However, this is a really sour attempt to get screen time for them. The way the witches are introduced may leave some good first impressions but overall lacks development. Sure, some of them even get a decent characterization but by adaptation standards, too much is left out. The structure of the show suffers a lot from cramming and some episodes even takes a lot to get their own stories started. Also, relationship dynamics are played more for comedy so it’s hard to take it seriously. On the plus side, I have to give some credit to the clever powers that the series introduces. Each witch has a different power and all of them can create some rather entertaining storytelling. Additionally, each of the witches has different personalities so the story does feel a bit refreshing with such a direction.
Despite having a lot of character and story pacing issues, one major aspect of the show that can win its audience over may be the comedy. The series isn’t a parody of witches but it can be genuinely funny. Yamada is a character that acts often in brash manners so his actions will definitely provoke some laughter if you see the trouble he gets himself into. Then, there are the powers. The concept of body swapping itself can be amusing to think about especially if a guy becomes a hot girl. Some of the other powers are troublesome but the show itself plays each gimmick cleverly to adapt with the developing story. There are also tons of kissing and although most series today makes it a highlight point between character relationships, this series does it casually and seems to be even self-aware. In general, comedy portrayal is a highlight and can be appreciated.
Artwork in general is generic yet works well. The character designs is what is attractive for the overall adaptation. The guys hardly stand out; well perhaps except Yamada. However, the girls really are designed with attractiveness such as Uraha. In particular, the witches are all noticeable in some way or form with their hairstyles, figures, and even status symbol. Despite taking place in the school setting, there’s a load going on besides just in the classrooms. In essence, we see many places of the school explored with a fine degree of clever decorating. I also have to give some praise to the character expressions as it enhances the comedy aspect of the series overall.
While I’m not a big fan of the soundtrack, the series does know how to utilize them. As the series portrays a lot of comedy, it’s important to capitalize on the atmosphere so the series makes use of more colorful OST. In most respects, it works well to get the viewers laughing. However, it’s nothing outstanding in terms of quality as it’s very standard. The OP and ED theme songs has a warm feeling to it though that is sung with a soft melancholic tone. But when it comes down to it, the characters’ voice mannerism will probably win you over. Yamada is a key figure to notice with his commanding voice as he gets into a lot of troublesome circumstances. Indeed, the series has this ability to communicate its gimmicks with the voices of the characters. Whether it’s the diverse voice mannerism of the witches, the Supernatural Club, or even the Student Council, it always seems to be noticeable.
Gender bender isn’t a new concept used by the anime industry. Neither are witch powers, kissing, or a club that investigates unusual cases. Rather, I take this show as more of a comedy story with a bit of clever gimmicks thrown in at you on a weekly basis. The episodes themselves each tell a story with something that sticks with the overall theme of the series. Just note that by adaptation and storytelling standards, it doesn’t shine well especially with the structure, rushing, and is easily predictable. On the plus side, the comedy really can bring some laughs. Ever had a bad day and you wanted something to laugh about? Perhaps this series can be what you’re looking for. The series itself is like a personality.",Negatif
"(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)
I think it is safe to say that everyone has a wish they want fulfilled. Money, power, and fame are the common ones, as they seem to be the most wanted. But money, power, and fame are not everything. More often than not, what we need most is not a shiny new car or rabid fans but instead something a bit more universal. A shoulder to lean on, a friend to hang out with, or a partner to hug; one of the greatest aspects in life are the relationships we share with the people around us.
For it is these very relationships that do what those previous three wishes cannot: make us happy for a lifetime. Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches is all about relationships, wishes, and of course witches, that provides an average outing overall.
STORY
The Seven Witches (as it will be named from here on out) stars Yamada-kun, a delinquent whose behavior makes him very difficult to associate with. One day, when walking up some steps, he falls, crashing into the top student of the school, Urara Shiraishi, which magically causes their bodies to switch. From there, the quest to find the other six witches begins.
Perhaps the anime’s greatest strength comes in the form of the theme it tackles: the importance of relationships. Whether it is with friends, family, or anyone in-between, people are always looking to form a connection with those around them. This is the main point of the show, with the witch powers revolving around such a concept. For instance, Shiraishi is able to switch bodies because she always wanted to experience a different lifestyle, Nene is able to coerce others because she was looking to gain increased support, Maria can see the future in order to have others avoid terrible fates, etc. As the anime depicts, the girls have these abilities and use them on their fellow classmates not because they can but because they wanted to have everlasting relationships that they could not obtain otherwise. Scenarios like Noa dealing with some teenagers’ hardships and Meiko working with students to perform better on their tests showcase the differing ways in which relationships are formed and comfort is found in others.
One of the best and simplest examples of the show’s emphasis on relationships that the anime employs is the kissing that is needed to use these witch powers. Kissing, be it on the hand, the cheek, or the lips, is a sign of affection towards another, and a known symbol of love between two people. Throughout the entirety of the anime, kissing is shared mostly between Yamada-kun and Shiraishi, but also between many more with gender being a second thought. Nobody thinks of it as anything more than a necessity until the end where Shiraishi clumsily goes through the act. She understands that now, after losing her power, the kiss’s true meaning is all that is left.
But it took a lot to get to that moment; the girls, despite being granted amazing gifts, do not find immediate solace. In fact, while their status gave them interesting abilities, at the same time their powers actually prevented them from maintaining the relationships they so desperately wanted. Certain situations, such as Saionji’s ability causing everyone to forget about her and Maria being unable to have a boyfriend, made it impossible to create such relationships. Worst still, those around them were affected, too; Yamada and Leona experience this firsthand through the loss they undergo. In this way, the conclusion of the anime – where the characters discover that it was not their powers that allowed them to all become such good friends but the experiences themselves – is a simple message that finishes the narrative nicely.
However, there is one glaring issue that The Seven Witches has, known as “firing and forgetting.” The anime follows usually the same sequence of events: learn of new witch, help this witch, and move on from said witch. There are minor discrepancies to this formula in the beginning (where the main group is being put together) and during one event in the middle (still dealing with forming the main group) but the show generally has the tendency to forego its most important aspect, namely the witches. Despite them all having interesting abilities, the anime refuses to use the girls in conjunction with one another or even after they have been discovered. This is strange because of the theme on relationships; one would think that, given the focus on it, such newfound relationships would play a more pivotal role in the scenarios encountered. Again, the non-witches are affected by this tactic as well because, after a certain point, cast members such as Miyamura and Miyabi are pushed to the side to make way for the anime’s next set of occurrences.
ANIMATION
One of The Seven Witches weakest areas is the art it utilizes. In short, it is boring; besides the characters themselves not visiting too many locations outside of their clubroom or other parts of the school, there is little in the way of detail. At the minimum, the show does use some pretty hysterical reaction faces – usually performed by Yamada-kun – that have the eyes bug out as giant, white spheres that have lost their pupils. It sounds scary but it works to make Yamada-kun seem even more incredulous.
The character designs are very nice, especially for the female characters. While they tend to follow typical tropes for the medium – an uncommon hair and color combination – it fits with the uniqueness the girls have due to them being witches. Shiraishi’s long blonde hair and jewel-like eyes, Nene’s short purple hair, and Maria’s earrings with pink hair and ponytail, with each wearing their school’s uniform, is quite attractive. Yamada-kun’s spiky blue hair and unkempt attire also coincides with his overall demeanor.
Actual animation is somewhere around average. There isn’t a whole lot of action within the anime itself and therefore little movement. Lots of dialogue and sitting around is had instead, with the characters really only being animated when going through those all-important kisses.
CHARACTERS
Due to the “firing and forgetting” method used on the characters, many of the witches only have minor background details given about them. There is very little in the way of development because the show just does not give them any time whatsoever. This is evident in characters like Meiko and Noa who, after their specific episode, have nothing else about them provided. Other characters, like Miyabi and Ushio, undergo the same treatment of initial divulgence on their persons followed by a stagnation of their character. Nene at least garners a bit more attention in the form of (ironic) unrequited love, but it is nothing worthwhile.
Two arguments arise as to why nearly the whole cast is little more than their personality traits: the comedic nature of the anime and the size of the cast. Since the show is more about inducing laughter than enacting drama, it becomes understandable that the characters are not entirely complex. Instead, by being only known for their individual shticks, the comedy is easier to handle and therefore present. As for the large cast size, the bigger it is, the more resources have to be spread evenly between everyone, devaluing each of the characters to a certain extent. That is, it becomes unrealistic to expect every cast member to be entirely fleshed out. This type of logic can be seen in most comedies involving a sizeable amount of characters, meaning them not being the most compelling of people is not too much of a negative.
The Seven Witches does put higher emphasis on two characters: Shiraishi and Yamada-kun. Shiraishi, as has been briefly described earlier, is the model student of the school. She is beautiful, gets great grades, and is respectful to those around her. Yet she has extreme difficulty connecting with others because many people are jealous of what she has, and for those that are not they cannot seem to understand the girl who hides behind her books. It is not until Yamada-kun shows up that she begins to open up. What is interesting is how the phrase “opposites attract” both does and does not apply. She is like Yamada-kun because they both find themselves unable to connect with people and she is unlike Yamada-kun because of her passiveness compared to his active behavior. That last fact is a constant factor, with her mostly tagging along for the whole season. To that end, at times she feels nonexistent which in turn stagnates her character, but at the minimum she opens up more so than she ever did before.
As for Yamada-kun, he is arguably the strongest character the anime has to offer. Upon entering high school, he wanted to leave behind his old self in favor of a new one, but found that he once more could not find a place to call his own. It is at this point that Yamada-kun stumbles upon and on Shiraishi, with the rest of the season following. The further along it goes, the more situations he finds himself in and subsequently the more relationships he establishes with the people around him. He almost loses them forever, but his newfound determination fostered throughout the series pulls through, with him saving Shiraishi and the other witches with a wish that makes perfect sense; Yamada-kun already has everything he could ever wish for, so him unburdening the girls now and in the future to form their own relationships brings everyone the greatest amount of happiness. At this point, the reason for him having such a power to start with becomes clear: not only did he need friends and relationships the most out of anyone in the school but it was what he wanted more than anything all along. Meaning, he was granted all of the witch powers – which were designed to create these connections – to eventually achieve his wish, and achieve his true wish he did.
SOUND
The opening theme starts and ends nicely, but the middle is rather repetitive. Listening to the piece more closely, the vocalist does nearly all of the work, while the instruments are composed in such a way as to bring about a mysterious yet hopeful vibe befitting the anime well enough. The ending theme mirrors its opening counterpart in that the singer does the heavy lifting; she has wonderful range and really carries the piece despite the boring beat.
The remainder of the soundtrack is nothing too notable. There are tracks that follow the feeling of magic through their strange-sounding instruments, hard-guitar riffs for Yamada-kun’s more rough-and-tumble encounters, piano melodies for the happy and sad times, and other tunes that find their place among the mystery that permeates many of the events. It is an OST that is not worth listening to outside of the anime itself, being little more than background noise.
Voice acting for the anime is somewhere slightly above average. Special shout-outs are deserved for Ryota Osaka as Yamada-kun for his accent and reactionary way of speaking and Saori Hayami as Shiraishi for her “manlier” way of speaking when Yamada-kun took over her body.
ENJOYMENT
Looking back through the anime, I found the first half or so pretty funny. Shiraishi was very cute, her interactions with Yamada-kun were always adorable, Miyabi and Miyamura were fun with their teasing, the body-switching created hilarious scenarios, and Nene’s embarrassment despite her confidence made for quite the happy times.
But when the show moved away from its comedic roots and into the more dramatic elements later on, it started to fall apart. Due to the progression of the story, there were fewer cute moments between the main couple, the side characters were pushed to the sidelines, the powers were used less and less, and due to the shift in tone the anime was not looking to make Nene blush but instead have her cry. To put it differently, when the anime was trying to be funny, it was, and when it was not, it really should have been.
The point about not utilizing the witch powers to their full extent, talked about here and in other areas, was also sad to see. When the anime places so much importance on the witches that it includes them in the title itself, and then proceeds to not do anything with them, it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. It is even worse when the witches and their personalities added some spice to the mix. Noa’s clinginess, Maria’s assertiveness, and Meiko’s dual personality were all quirks that the anime could have leveraged but failed to do so.
Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches has an interesting premise that ultimately does not go anywhere. Its themes are personable and some of its characters are interesting, but the misuse of its cast, the lackluster art, and the lame soundtrack bring the whole package down. While Yamada-kun and Shiraishi live happily ever after, this one still needs a wish of its own.
SUMMARY
Story: Fine, theme on relationships is executed nicely but “firing and forgetting” is rampant
Animation: Fine, boring art style, fitting reaction faces, nice character designs, about average actual animation
Characters: Good, Nene and the side characters are passable, Shiraishi is okay, with Yamada-kun undoubtedly being a strong character
Sound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, boring soundtrack, slightly above average VA work
Enjoyment: Fine, Shiraishi is adorable, with the show being hilarious earlier rather than later
Final Score: 5/10",Negatif
"Short:
The anime felt very rushed compared to the manga. Everyone seems to instantly respond to every action, thus losing much of the impact and emotion between exchanges. Some of the manga parts seemed to be added in just because it was in the manga, except some of the preludes were completely skipped which made it seemed very forced. Overall, I didn't really like this adaptation as it felt more like a summary of the manga than an actual fully fleshed anime.
*Spoilers Ahead*
Story: 7
This comes from the fact that we seem to be missing a few chunks of the story here and there probably due to
the episode limitations. The whole searching for witches and yamada's reasons felt very superficial where he does things just because the story needs him as the protagonist, rather than him having actual reasons.
Art 9:
I felt that the art truly reflected the original's, not to mention that I feel it's actually a bit better. Miki (the author/artist) occasionally had some issues with the art, which I didn't notice here.
Sound 8:
Didn't really like the OP or ED songs. The voice selections suited their characters, though maybe the president could have been someone different, not really sure who, but I felt that his voice didn't really suit the character. For BGM, there wasn't much that caught my attention.
Character 6:
Like stated earlier, everything just felt rushed. Their characters don't really feel fleshed out and everything they do don't really coincide with their character because we weren't given enough information beforehand (e.g. Miyamura's sister was actually a secret he wanted to keep but just stated it to everyone without much of an issue). I really felt that they should have adapted less of the manga and do each episode more thoroughly.
--Example 1: Yamada refuses to rejoin the Supernatural Club because he believes they're better off without him, but this isn't actually explained in the anime.
--Example 2; Yamada also runs through a few thoughts before confessing to Shiraishi but this is skipped in the anime for some reason, which makes the confession really random/abrupt.
Enjoyment: 7
It wasn't as enjoyable as the manga as everything happened way too quick without much time for people to really grasp the mood. It really felt like we were just skipping from scene to scene and being fed the main points of each scene.
Overall 7:
First anime I've watched where I've read the manga beforehand, so maybe I'm being a bit harsh. But it was definitely less enjoyable watching the anime than it was reading the manga. There was a real lack of romantic atmosphere between Yamada and Urara kissing. Perhaps even the voice acting was a bit rushed. Overall, I think there really should have been a few moments where each important character could engage in a short thought monologue.",Negatif
"TL;DR: Rushed as f*ck.
No spoilers here.
Yamada-kun and the 7 Witches was one of the anime that I was dreading this season. Why? Because it was one-cour. The story arc that could be concluded with the manga as it is now is either over 80 chapters in or an original ending, and with the sweet spot of manga to anime adaptation being 2-3 chapters an episode, 80 could be a little too much in 24 episodes, even if filler is cut. Well, for better and for worse, Yamada-kun met and exceeded my expectations.
But let’s talk about the good stuff first.
Yamada-kun and the 7 Witches (which I
will abbreviate as 7 Witches) follows the titular Ryu Yamada, a second year delinquent who is all alone in a rather prestigious school. When walking up the stairs threateningly near the class genius and beauty, the diminutive Urara Shiraishi, he accidentally falls down the stairs on top of her. To their extreme surprise, they switched bodies. After walking in each other shoes, Yamada realizes Shiraishi is being bullied and, against her will, helps put an end to it. They then discover they can switch back by kissing. Subsequently, Yamada and Shiraishi get embroiled within the contest for Student Council President, create the Supernatural Studies Club, and search for the 7 Witches, who have powers similar to body-swapping.
Premise aside, 7 Witches’ key strengths are its art and extremely ball-busting humor, drawing from ecchi, physical, character-driven, and wordplay based humor. The anime always succeeds here. Linden does a tremendous job in animating here, making the environments of Suzaku High School seem especially grand and high-class. Many girls have extremely strange hair colors (green, blue, pink, whatever), and while they appear strange in the manga, Linden does a pretty good job at making them seem less jarring in the anime. Facial expressions are rendered extremely carefully, elevating the humor, which is usually done right. Aside from kissing, there is some playful fanservice here, and while it does get grating, the anime, in adapting, skips out on some of the fanservice as well, which is actually a plus, especially for those who are averse to such elements.
The true star of this entire anime is by far the voice work. I have to give amazing credit to the characters who generally swap bodies: Ryota Ohsaka (Yamada), Saori Hayami (Shiraishi), Toshiki Masuda (Toranosuke Miyamura) and Maaya Uchida (Miyabi Ito). When the characters swap bodies, each voice actor immediately switches their delivery to match the personality currently inhabiting their character. Hayami, who typically does quitter or gentler female roles, becomes bombastic and crude when Yamada is in Shiraishi’s body. Similarly, whenever Shiraishi inhabits Yamada, Ohsaka delivers in a very terse and gentle tone. Masuda and Uchida also do a splendid job when body swapping is going on, but Ohsaka and Hayami are, without question, amazing.
The rest of the voice cast does an amazing job, because 7 Witches’ voice cast is stacked. To single out some of the biggest names here, Eri Kitamura voices Nene Odagiri, Aoi Yuki voices Noa Takigawa, Kana Hanazawa voices Mikoto Asuka, Daisuke Ono voices Ushio Igarashi, Miyuki Sawashiro voices Leona Miyamura, and Jun Fukuyama voices Student Council President Haruma Yamazaki.
This is where the praise stops, because Linden decided to make this one-cour instead of two.
The original 7 Witches manga had some filler that could have been taken out without too much trouble. A subplot with the girls’ archery club president, Karen Kimishima, was cut out, and ultimately, that does not matter. Some arcs could be cut a little shorter without too much trouble, such as the arc focusing around Maria Sarushima or the arc surrounding Noa. But 7 Witches wasn’t filled with so much fluff to be able to cut much more than this, so the amount of corner-cutting when it comes to plot make certain developments jarring and eliminates the impact of some of the arcs.
(Some subtle foreshadowing sprinkled within the early chapters that reference the ongoing arc in the manga are cut entirely, so if that’s ever adapted, it will seem less clever and more out of left field.)
The final arc of the anime was a rushed and hollow shadow of what was in the manga, which is a severe disappointment. Due to this corner cutting, all characters other than Yamada (and to a much lesser extent, Shiraishi) that had character development don’t have any. Admittedly, some characters don’t have much character development still don’t, like Ito, Kentaro Tsubaki, and a couple of the witches. However, other characters lose both their motivations and screentime, making them hollow shells of people and not actual characters. The best way to describe this is in quick list form.
-Shiraishi loses her dry, cutting humor, making her more generic.
-Toranosuke Miyamura’s motivation in the manga doesn’t exist in the anime.
-Leona Miyamura’s motivation is heavily watered down.
-Odagiri’s, Ushio’s, Noa’s, and Yamazaki’s cut scenes make them more one-dimensional in the anime.
Yamada is pretty much the only major character to come through the adaptation unscathed, but with the other characters being rather weak, it prevents the anime from being a good adaptation.
Many adaptations come in too soon and have to rush or make an original ending. This was not that. Linden’s rushed 12 episode adaptation of Yamada made it lose most of its plot and character based strengths. More than a faithful retelling, it often feels like a highlights reel of the plot. The presentation is beyond stellar, but when the plot and characters are diluted to such an extent, it’s hard to be happy with this anime.
Story - 5 (premise is OK to begin with, anime cuts down on many strengths)
Art - 8 (beautiful animation)
Sound - 9 (music is forgettable but the voice acting is amazing)
Character - 5 (all characters except Yamada are hollow)
Enjoyment - 4 (as a manga lover, this rushed adaptation hurts)
Overall - 6.2 (rounded to 6)

"Have you ever wondered what would happen if you had the power to switch bodies with someone else? No? How about the power of charm, telepathy, or seeing the future? Or maybe you've thought about invisibility, dreaming of traumatic events, or even erasing memories? Still not impressed? Well, what if you had to KISS someone in order to use one of those seven powers? Mm-hmm, I think I've caught your attention now.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my review of Yamada and the Seven Witches, also known in Japanese as Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo.
Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches is about Ryuu Yamada, a delinquent in
his second year at Suzaku High School. One day, he accidentally falls down a flight of stairs, crashing into the school's top student, Urara Shiraishi, in the process. When Yamada regains consciousness, he discovers that he has switched bodies with Shiraishi. When they switch back, they discover that kissing causes them to switch bodies. It is later discovered that there are seven witches at Suzaku High School, each of them possessing a unique power. Together with the newly-revived Supernatural Studies Club, they set out to discover the identities of these seven witches.
Although I've never read the manga before, I've known about it for quite a while because of its popularity. That's why when the anime was announced, I jumped at the chance to watch it. I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd hoped I would, but it still turned out to be a great anime in all other aspects.
The story is well put-together, and I liked that it focused on powers other than body swapping. Each of the characters were developed quite well, especially the witches. You cannot forget the main characters, though. Yamada was a fun character from beginning to end, and Shiraishi was quite an interesting one. The other members of the Supernatural Studies Club, Miyamura (the student council vice president), Itou (the supernatural-obsessed girl), and Tsubaki (a transfer student who is introduced later), each have their moments of brilliance or hilariousness.
The voice acting was done very well, and each voice actor fit their character as well as possible. I didn't care for the ending theme, ""Candy Magic"", that much, but I absolutely LOVE the opening, ""Kuchizuke Diamond""! It's very catchy and well-sung; it's easily one of the best opening themes of the season where it aired. The best part of this anime, though, was the animation. It was so vivid and well-done!
Thinking about it, I wonder why I didn't enjoy Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches so much, because what is there not to like about it? I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the manga. Or maybe I should read the manga myself and see if the anime was any different from it? I don't know.",Negatif

Blaaaaaah! That's me being disgusted of the MC guy kissing a guy, GAAAAAAY! Awwwwww, and this is me were me likey see MC guy kissing girls, so what we have is an anime/ manga or Novel were it has a gender bender/Yaoi/ Yuri element in it, but then again in it's overall theme it more
like a bisexual thingy were it involves magic , romance, comedy and some action and it involves the misadventures of the MC guy where it started him meeting witch number 1   Shiraishi Urara, and from there it goes to romance,, his meeting with the Supernatural studies club and Student Council President wannabe Toranosuke Miyamura is were the yaoi thingy starts....ok so in some aspects the MC guy is actually kissing a girl inside a boy's body, but it still disgust me out that it still makes me wanna puke, anyways with such unique plot , the part where the MC guy's task to find the 7 witches was an adventure on itself and plus the fact stick to just one of them was a real climax. Usually I avoid any animes or mangas with a yaoi thingy, this was the only one were I make an exception. So basically the story (up) itself is indeed very good. On the art category (up) I just gave it a ""Good"" for the fanservice and that's that. Sound(up) well Ryuu Yamada's voice has a bit of a mature tone in it, I guess his VA's doesn't have what it takes to do a delinquent's voice,  Shiraishi's voice if she is  Shiraishi, does have a cute tone , but in a masculine tone she sounded like a MILF.  Odagiri's VA Eri Kitamura no longer have the youthful tone and  so as Leona Miyamura's VA Miyuki Sawashiro, but then again the sound category it still ""Fair"" enough for me. On the character category(up), ok so the MC guy is a campus bad boy, but then again I like the way that he was portrayed as a double standard where at one point he's very aggressive but soft hearten, the comic aspect about him  was that he can be horny at one point, but is a pussy when seeing a girl's pussy, frankly he more like a reverse Snow White, let's not forget that this anime's title is ""Yamada and the 7 witches"" in it's English, in fact nearly every character's in this anime are seemly based on a classic fairy tale 'Snow white and the Seven  Dwarfs, so lets go over some of them:
Yamada Ryuu- Like I've said he's a reverse version of ""Snow White"" and unlike the classic fairy tale , we don't see him eat an apple and goes to sleep.
The 7 witches:
Shiraishi Urara - is this anime/manga's version of Dopey, remember in the classic fairy tale, Dopey is the closes to Snow White and just like the said character, she's very much receptive of the MC Guy.
Odagiri Nene- is this anime/manga's version of  Grumpy, and it's obvious that like Grumpy she too is always in a bad mood and a typical quintessential tsundere.
Maria Sarushima- like Doc from the classic fairy tale, she to mixes up her words, but unlike the Doc, she on the other hand supplements it wit a couple of English words.
Noa Takigawa- she is like Sleepy from the classic fairy tale, but pretty much different, since in the anime/ manga she more of a reluctant type who wants to get rid of the witches power that retaining it.
Meiko Ootsuka- well pretty much she does share some characteristic with Bashful from the classic fairy tale, since they both shy and don't speak a lot.
Mikoto Asuka-  well in this anime she can qualify as Sleepy from the classic fairy-tale, but I can't say the same in the manga, since there are indications that she speaks.
Rika Saionji-  I don't know if she can qualify as  Sneezy, but then again just like in the classic fairy tale they both have something extraordinary.
Others:
Leona Miyamura- she is more like the magic mirror.
Toranosuke Miyamura- he is the Prince (Gay) Charming, eeeewwww.
Miyabi Itou and Kentarou Tsubaki_- I suppose that they're the Humtsman.
Haruma Yamazaki and Shinichi Tamaki- Well I'm guessing that they're this anime's evil witch.
Well, I guess with such character's being pattern after the classic fairy tale, I guess it's all good.
Enjoyment(up), well aside from the trouble that the MC guy's getting into trouble with the witches were it was funny, there is also the fanservice that I like and it's all good. But in it's overall, it really wasn't original, when such concept was copied from the classic fairly tale with a twist, also the term witches was more of an overused terminology were it doesn't really comply with character's portrayal since their magical abilities were too limited, it was kinda odd that author  Yoshikawa, Miki has to exaggerated something that was too limited with the character's portrayals, the title itself was seemly a patsy , the author should have title his creation as ""The 7 Troublesome Magic Users of Yamada"" or ""The 7 Magical Gurls of Yamada.""  so I'm really gonna give this anime a 3. PEACE.",Negatif
"If you are remotely interested in the premise of this show, and have yet to read the manga, I beg you, READ THE MANGA FIRST. Reading the Manga before or after watching an anime usually doesn't bother me, but trust me on this one. This adaptation has a really big problem, and it will affect how you enjoy Yamada-kun and the 7 Witches.
The main problem? Pacing. This anime has a really bad pacing issue, maybe even one of the worst. The story arc that the anime is trying to adapt spans over a total of 90 chapters. Yes, nine-zero. Let me remind you that this
is a 1-cour anime, meaning it only has 12 episodes. And in that 12 episodes they have to cram the development of the 7 witches, numerous side characters, and surprising plot twists. It looks like the studio tried its best to adapt it to its fullest, but accomplishing a feat like that may be borderline impossible.
Not to mention, Yamada-kun is a complicated enough story as it is. Cramming it into 12 episodes not only emphasizes its weaknesses, but develops new ones as well, like rushed developments and exposition dialogue. Giving it 2-cour may very well solve its issues, but the fact of the matter is they tried to cram a story as convoluted as Yamada-kun into 12 episodes.
But does that mean you should avoid this show like the plague? Hell no! This anime is actually insanely fun when you get into the crux of it. The characters are all lively and hilarious. The interactions with the kisses is pretty cool, and can make you giddy from time to time. Though the music is not particularly outstanding, the OP, 'Kuchizuke Diamond', has to be one of my personal favorite OP's in anime. Every time I hear it I just have to drum my lap and tap my foot to the beat.
Also, this show has to be one of the best demonstrations of just how talented Japanese VA's are. The show plays around body-switching, and the results produced when our MC and Lead Girl (both polar opposite personalities) are outstanding. How the VA's capture the personality of the person they switch it shows immense talent and mastery. I have to give special kudos to Hayami Saori as well, a VA that I've been fond of because of her recurring roles as an archetypal kuudere, one of my favorite tropes. This anime showcases that she actually has great vocal range, playing the vulgar MC easily. This is the show that made me put her into one of my all time favorite VA's.
If you want the full Yamada-kun experience, please do read the manga instead. The story and character relationships are touched upon better there, and the pacing is a lot better. It's actually pretty good; you will not regret the time used while reading it.
But if you have already read the manga and loved it like me, by all means do not let this pass. There is enough here to make you overlook its pacing issues, and by the end you will find this a satisfying adaptation of the manga.",Negatif
"STORY: Ryu Yamada is your average student. A rough and intimidating delinquent on the outside, but on the inside, he’s a huge softy. Bored with school, and his life, from what the anime makes out, he has a sudden turn of events when he crashes into, Urara Shiraishi, the top student of the entire school. Falling unconscious during their crash incident, Yamada wakes up in the nurse’s office, later realizing he has switched bodies with Shiraishi. After countless tries to return to each other’s original bodies, other classmates, Miyabi Ito and Toranouske Miyamura, catch on to what has happened between Shiraishi and Yamada. Which later
they involve Yamada and Shiraishi in the rebirth of the Supernatural club at their school. Yamada and company realize that he has powers transferable through a kiss.
Cliché? Or, a new type of romatic-school-comedy?  You be the judge on that.
The club encounters other students with powers similar to Yamada and Shiraishi and then the Supernatural club takes a turn and becomes a club to hunt down the other students with supernatural powers, formally known as, witches. As the school year and their hunt continues, new students and witches make brief appearances to join them in their quest.
ART & ANIMATION: The animation was brilliant. So far 2015 for anime’s animation and sounds have been up to their best potential. I truly enjoyed watching it. Everything was well drawn, the scenery was tasteful and the music brought ease and rage into my mood when watching this. All in all, this was good for sore eyes and deaf ears. The ending song leaves you stuck with a catchy tune, that you’ll even find yourself humming in the shower. Something you’ll grow to love and wish there were more anime with a high caliber as this. In terms of animation and sound, of course
Catchy music and sounds, with a nice crisp pen to paper to bring finesse and fluidity to an anime, what more can you ask for? Seriously?
CHARACTERS: This is where this anime starts taking its toll on me, while the cast extends much more than your average anime, 7+ main and supporting characters. Their roles were butchered and taken out of the oven way TOO fast. The witches’ spotlight and backstories were bland and tasteless. Their character development lacked detail and consistency. Even Yamada’s development through the story got generic to the point where you’re asking yourself, “why am I still watching this”? I appreciate one thing, and that’s, his lack of being shy and an oblivious mess. But, confidence and assertiveness only takes you so far. While the chemistry between Yamada and Shiraishi was more thank believably natural, I still can’t get myself to enjoy their subliminal love for each other.
CONS: There had to be more. Maybe it’s the time restraint this anime had. 12 episodes, they’re starting to become less efficient, either that or these publishers and authors are really looking forward to making a quick buck, so they forcefed this to us thinking we would indulge in such nonsense and laziness. So, yes, if you haven’t caught on, the rushed events between Yamada and each witch was poor and discouraging, the rushed and forced relationship between yamada and the witches seemed like a last minute add on. Their backstories had no consistency. I know a lot of people that read the manga, I am not included in this statistic, but I have been told that the manga is one million times better.  So much was cut out, not just comedy but little bits of development that would make character relationships feel like they had a connection.
OVERALL/ENJOYMENT: With everything stated, it seems more of a rant than an actual review, but that’s usually what happens in anime adaptions. Unfortunately, not all 12 episode anime will get the justice they deserve. I enjoyed this to a certain extent. Up to episode 5, until each new witch had their backstories ruined and the character developments and connections shot. I would recommend this anime to those that have nothing else to watch, more for casual days. I would also recommend reading the manga over this, which I will later begin myself. So much potential ruined by unorganized and rushed plans.
VERDICT: 6/10

"tl;dr: A series that rushes through too much with too many characters, in order to reach an ending that although great, isn't worth how rushed the journey was.
This anime feels like it has some good concepts, but it was rushed too much for it to really click with me. The general premise and character setup is interesting and could work well. The humor was also decent enough though not particularly hilarious. However, the main problem is that it has way too many characters with their own stories and backgrounds for a 12 episode series to handle effectively. The end result is that the pacing is
pretty bad with most of it being rushed through, not really developing most characters beyond their basic introduction and premise and also introducing a lot of important information just in passing. This latter aspect is especially evident during the final arc, where how the power works isn't really clear and feels largely inconsistent with how the powers have worked in general. It also feels like characters behave in ways that don't really make sense considering what they should know and how their character should be. Still, the cast of characters is pretty good even if it feels that most of them got no development, and I can understand why they tried to rush through so much in so little time. The anime goes through an introduction for each of the 7 witches and then goes onto a major finale. The finale itself, despite aforementioned issues, is largely pretty great, and where it ends especially is a fantastic place for the series to end on to the point I'm incredibly curious where the manga goes in the story beyond this as this was pretty much the perfect place to end. Hence, to rush through everything to hit this finale in a single season is a decision that I can understand, though ultimately I don't think it was worth it because while the ending is great, it isn't enough to make up for how underdeveloped most of the season felt.
The art, designs, and animation were okay. The OP and ED were decent. The soundtrack wasn't particularly memorable.",Negatif
"[Adapted From Original Blog Post]
[Mini Review]
Yamada is yet another school life comedy that tries to differentiate itself through a certain gimmick, in this case one of the supernatural kind that seeks to initiate amusing character interactions and forward the story, the plot only moving forward as more ideas keep churning in and shaking up the formula. Readers of the manga will tell you the narrative is extremely rushed, and I agree, characters often drop in and out of importance unritualistically, and there's not enough time to possibly develop them all as the show makes a point of introducing new characters and supernatural every episode to
keep the fun moving. But that's the nice thing about Yamada, it's 12 episodes of charming and entertaining randomness spliced with romance and hints of ecchi that is easy to digest and is gone before you know it, and that's all it needs to do, as you never need to think about it again.
It knows how to do its job and well, and though the job of a slice-of-life supernatural harem isn't one with many rewards in terms of deep characters or a plot that doesn't nearly completely rely on coincidences and contrivances, it still executes with contagious energy and a sense of self awareness. If you go into Yamada with the right expectations, you'll get exactly what you came for, and that's great; the show serving well as a breather in between more heavy and complex anime. It's not likely you won't find something to like: the characters have great chemistry even with the ever-growing roster, the animation is pretty and cute, and the opening song is actually quite amazing all things considered, at the very least, it's not something you'll want to skip often, even serving as a tool for emotional attachment in some cases.
What's surprising is that the show actually finds its strength in the more dramatic moments as opposed to the zaniness of the everyday-life comedy. Character backstories are thought-out and effective, even if said characters usually drop out of the narrative picture once their one episode of focus is over, which nearly counter-balances what the show does well with the cast. Our two leads however: Yamada and Shiraishi, are surprisingly well developed and enduring, and if you're willing to give just a little emotional investment towards these two and the rest of the cast, the anime will pay you back in an emotionally charged finale that still remembers elation and hijinks are the real cores of this show, and never tries to stray too far from those roots and asks for the viewer to give unrealistic amounts of craps about what is happening. And don't too many craps either, because even if you're invested, don't ever forget what this show really is, because if you lose sight of that amidst the occasional drama, you're going to end up expecting what the anime can't give you: true depth and truly good writing. But despite that, Yamada is still one hell of a good time.
Final Verdict: 5.5/10
P.S: Yeah, she just wanted to kiss.

"I actually watched this show on a whim. And at first glance the premise of the show seems like it could have been really interesting. That premise was that Yamada switched bodies with a girl Urara Shiraishi. This, in itself, could have been a very interesting and comedic narrative. Actually, scratch that, it would have been the best romantic comedy ever.
Unfortunately the narrative gets bogged down by introducing 6 other ""witches"" and an almighty student council. So it just becomes a paranormal investigation to hunt down and find the other witches.
I feel like there was a missed opportunity here. Cramming all of this into 12
episodes was also a hatchet job. There were way too many characters for this to even work. At least for the first couple episodes it works.",Negatif
"Overall, the anime is not bad. There was definitely a lot that the writers could work with. But I couldn't help thinking that this was very similar to Kokoro connect, but instead of have some random alien mess with you, you have these witches that basically do the same thing. In addition, since there were so many characters and only 12 episodes, I felt like the story was rushed and I wasn't really able to get to know the characters --- I wasn't really able to get into it. The only thing I really ended up caring about in the end was the relationship between
the two main characters, but even that wasn't too well developed. Also, the flow was kind of confusing at times, especially with all the power stealing from the main character and the number of characters affected by these powers in one given episode. Art and music is good enough, not much to say as it didn't particularly stand out. I probably won't rewatch this anime again, but it's good for if you're looking for something cute and light hearted with a touch of magic.",Negatif
"There are some vague spoilers in this.
Ever wonder what you get when you mix Kokoro Connect, Date a Live, and Haruhi? Well, probably not, but this show is the closest thing to it.
Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches follows Yamada and his friends in the Supernatural Studies Club as they try to find all seven ""witches"" who hold special powers in their high school. Sure, it's an original concept for a high school harem show, but originality doesn't save this ridiculous plot. Nothing is ever explained about the ""witches"" and the students always seem to figure out exactly what's going on even though the information they
have about this phenomenon is little to none. The first four episodes gave me a different impression than what the show actually was. After the whole “switching bodies” gimmick was established, I expected to see the hilariously wacky antics of a club who can switch bodies with each other. I don’t know why I expected that; the title of the show obviously tells us that there are six more witches, so I guess that’s my bad for thinking that. What ended up happening, though, was some overly dramatic version of The World God Only Knows. Yamada has to find all seven witches and kiss them. Why? They tried to make a weak explanation about how they needed to find all seven witches to stop the student council president from being bad, but we all know it was simply to build Yamada's harem.
Speaking of the harem, that's something I can praise this show about. It's like a harem that's not a harem, because every girl doesn't ache in starvation for MC's dick. Even so, he still finds an excuse to kiss basically every character introduced.
Finally, in the last few episodes, an unexpected crisis broke out and tried to make things seem dramatic and exciting, but I couldn't take the show seriously enough to worry about the characters at all. Oh, and the ending was weak and extremely predictable too.
Overall, the plot of this show is not good in the slightest. In fact, I'm more inclined to believe it's being satirical of the generic anime stereotypes: harems, magic witch girls, powers activate with a kiss, etc. In its defense, 12 episodes is not very much time to introduce the main characters, 7 other girls, and end the whole thing. Pacing issues (which there were plenty of) are almost inevitable. Another good thing they did was give a clear ending of the show, including both the story and the harem. All in all, I give the story a 3.
The art is high quality. I noticed this especially in the characters' eyes. Other than that, design-wise, there is nothing to complain about. All the girls look great and different. I give art a 7.
The sound isn't notable really. I do remember one background song that I liked, but that's it. As for voice acting, it was pretty average. Nothing was bad enough that it significantly worsened my viewing experience, but I didn't like Yamada's voice because he was always yelling and it got old quick. I give sound a 6.
Because of the harem aspect, the characters are basically the main focus of the series. Yamada is a generic high school main character. At the beginning, he doesn't try in school, ends up befriending the most beautiful and smartest chick in the grade, and becomes overly protective of his two-week-old friends. Nothing new and nothing special about him. Shiraishi is the main female character. She's the ""quiet/smart girl"" and also not very special except for her top tier looks. Next we have Miyamura and Ito, the other initial members of the Supernatural Studies Club, who aren't very important to the story. The only reason they stick around is because they know about the witches' powers. Now we get to the harem. Every girl is made for a specific character type and aren't remarkable in any way except for being there for otaku nerds to pick and choose their favorite to fantasize about. Some of them appear for one episode then almost never again. There are some other characters introduced, like the evil student council president and some guy named Ushio who I still confuse with the other 2 supporting males. I give the characters a 6.
The show gets a 5 for enjoyment. In the beginning I was convinced it was the best show ever and would stand out as a beautiful diamond in the shitfield that is modern romance anime. As it went on, I soon realized it was no different than any other harem. The only reason I stuck it out for the last few episodes was because I heard beforehand that there was actual romantic development at the end so I guess there's that going for it.
In total I give the show a 5. It was all over the place and didn't ever decide on what genre it wanted to be. If you're watching it for a crappy harem, you'll probably enjoy the different take it provides. If you're watching for an actual romance/comedy, there is at least satisfying romance at the end except almost zero good comedy.",Negatif
"Quick review time!
I gotta be honest, this anime took me by surprise. I was expecting the basic 7/10 high school romance anime, which is kinda what I got ..but only at first.
So like I said, the start kind of rubbed me the wrong way, some conversations seemed a bit awkward and the animation was a little clunky. There were also red flags of the typical fanservice. Luckily, it was still watchable so I gave it a chance. The middle of it, it got good. I enjoyed the humor, likable characters, and the way they handled the ""harem."" Tbh I didn't even notice it was classified
as one until the end. I mean, for me who utterly despises harem, I can safely say that wasn't the main focus (thank god). But then, this is what caught me by surprise. I was gonna write it off as sold 7/10 but then the ending happened. It had such a well built-up tension that I never saw coming. I won't say more but let's just say I genuinely felt concerned for the characters, and I won't lie, a little tear fell from my face.
Lastly, should you watch this? Yes, if you like silly humor with a slice of cliche love stories. Even if you aren't one for slow starts you should give this a chance. Now, if you don't like, let's just say, fanservice and cliche animes, don't watch this.",Negatif
"The manga is like a 10/10 masterpiece, but this anime adaptation was rushed to make it fit into 12 episodes.
For the example, the scene where Odagiri sees Yamada & Shiraishi kiss, the anime was rushed and didn't give the scene enough time to make the viewers feel like it's a big heartbreaking moment for Odagiri (like how it was in the manga).
If you're about to start watching this, I recommend you to read the manga first, and then comeback to watch the anime as a bonus. Don't ruin your own experience by watching the anime first.",Negatif
"One of the things that has kind of left a bad taste in my mouth is the relationship between Yamada and Ushio. It's been about a year since I dropped the show and I can't just go back to it. Seeing how easy it was for him to treat his friend basically like trash and as if he never existed. Even bringing into account Nene, it still doesn't change it. I might pick up the manga later down the road, but until then I can't. Other than that the story seemed alright and the character development was decent, but I feel like the story could've
been told better than how it was at the point I dropped the show. I could be wrong and the story could've gotten better, but from what I've seen it's stayed between decent and semi-decent.",Negatif
"From the start of the season this was the thing I was the most excited about. While it did have its good points, it ultimately became the thing that most disappointed me of the Winter 2017 season. I will now proceed to tell you why in EXCRUCIATING detail.
Our setting is the Kingdom of Dowa: a continent/kingdom made up of many districts, shaped like a bird, and populated by gangly noodle-people. Our hero is Jean Otus, a blond guy who smokes cigarettes, wears jackets, and works in the titular governmental organization ACCA as some sort of district inspector. This is about all we know about
him. Also he has a sister and a friend with blue hair.
Jean is tasked with visiting the various districts of Dowa and ""auditing"" them, which consists of 50% looking through file cabinets at papers in a very boring way and 50% coincidentally stumbling into dramatic events that all seem to center around Jean while somehow also not involving him at all. Superficially tense political games and a lot of talking ensue.
Pros:
A.) It looks awesome. ACCA has a very distinct visual style, managing to be both vibrant and relaxed. It has the feel of a watercolor painting: colorful but also a bit ethereal.
B.) Both the OP and ED are great, the first being a fun cool colorful romp and the second a stunningly animated tranquil dance scene.
C.) I mostly really like the characters, with Jean himself being the notable and unfortunate exception. He is either very subtle or very boring, and unfortunately we find out by the end that he is very much the latter. I ended up having to look up his name to write this review, because I couldn't remember if it was ""Jean"" or ""Jin."" All the side characters are fun and interesting, so that’s something.
Cons:
A.) As mentioned before, Jean himself. Everybody in the show itself seem to think he is the greatest most interesting shit in the world. Either he is a secret genius who is playing his cards SUPER close to the vest and not showing us any of it, or he isn't and is actually the most boring man in the world whose only personality trait seems to be that he is a smoker.
B.) The pacing is garbage. It is SLOW and feels SLOOWER.
C.) Like Mushishi it is not in a rush to get anywhere, but unlike Mushishi it ultimately never does. The story immediately lags and it gets boring quickly.
D.) It is not in the least bit exciting. There have been moments of charm that have made me want to get more, but they are not frequent enough to make me instantly want to watch another episode.
The biggest problem with the show by the end was that nobody changed or developed in the slightest. They are all exactly the same at the end of the show as they were at the start. The sad truth is that the character that underwent the most development was the coddled prince’s servant Magie, whose development consists of him learning that he likes bread.
A lot of anime get criticized for being nothing but talking, but beside eating bread and smoking cigarettes more or less nothing else occurred in 12 episodes. It was constant exposition that ended up settling up nothing. It is a crying shame because the characters look great and the world is super cool, but the show reminded me of a Kardashian in that it looks pretty and very effortfully crafted but is ultimately unengaging because it is devoid of any depth or interest.
SPOILER ALERT AHEAD
It doesn’t matter anyway because you shouldn’t watch the show, and it won’t ruin anything because there is nothing to ruin, but I though I’d warn you. It seems only polite.
Most of the previous complaints I have about this show disappointed me, but this one pissed me the f off. The only “bad” people in this show are brown, and the only brown people in this show are “bad.” The show also does a great job of very pointedly not calling them “Arabs,” which just serves to call attention to the brown skinned, oil wealthy, immoral, racist elephant in the room. Literally the only people of color of any significance in this entire postulated world are portrayed as greedy manipulative villains. In the end they choose to just go away and sit in the corner so all the white people can resume their blissful perfect lives. I will also add that I, myself, am white as the driven snow. I am not saying this out of any feelings that the show has attacked me personally. It was so blatant that it made me, not a target of the seemingly intentional demonization of a group of people, feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable. Do better guys. We are better than this.
So Jean is, in fact, playing a long game, but unfortunately that long game turns out to be Monopoly: the most tedious, dialogue heavy, longest game of all. His master plan is literally designed to ensure that nothing will change, and that the huge amount of narrative debt that the show has built up after 12 episodes of stoic talky political drama is entirely unpaid. Every single problem presented throughout the run of the show is wrapped up in a neat little bow with no bloodshed or ill will. Except, of course, on the part of the brown people, but as we have previously established they do not matter due to the fact that they are brown because they are evil and evil because they are brown. It is so painfully contrived and saccharine that it made me a little embarrassed to watch on behalf of the writer.
As if to drive my point home, the last line of dialogue in the show is “We really haven’t changed, have we?,” with the feeling that it is being delivered directly to camera with a cheeky wink. No, ACCA, you have not. But I have. At the beginning I kind of liked you. Here at the end I have nothing but disappointment and pity left for what you could’ve been.",Negatif
"ACCA is an anime in which nothing ever comes to fruition. Plot points are introduced and dissolved with no ripple effect whatsoever; all of the show's potential goes completely wasted on sandwich bread and cigarettes.
CHARACTERS: 3/10
While many of the characters are likeable, almost all of them are flat and uninteresting, including the protagonist, Jean.
The most interesting characters in the story are Jean's best friend Nino and one of the five chief officers of ACCA, Lilium. These are the two characters with the most thought put into their backstories and intentions.
Jean himself is the most boring character in the show. He doesn't seem to have any
goals or ambitions. He doesn't seem to have any drive or emotion. He's completely deadpan the entire time, at most cracking a smirk or raising an eyebrow.
STORY: 6/10
Do not be fooled: this is not an anime filled with political intrigue like all of the descriptions say. This is an anime about baked goods and cigarettes and I can't explain that any further without veering into spoilers.
The first seven episodes each spend time setting up dominoes only to knock them down the very same episode and then never address them again. If you only watch the first three episodes of the series, I will tell you now that you will never again hear of the serial arson plotline even though it goes completely unresolved. The same happens for every single interesting plot point that gets put forward. You spend 18 minutes excited to see how things all come together, then in the last 3 minutes before the end credits, Jean stumbles through, everything falls apart, no consequences are felt, and nothing changes. This is the cycle until Episode 8, when things finally pick up.
The plot twist at the end of Episode 7 is where things get really interesting, even if you picked up on all the hints and saw it coming. Unfortunately, Episodes 8-11 are the only episodes worth watching, as Episode 12 completely shirks all of the buildup from the previous episodes and tries to tie everything up in a neat little bow. It's rushed. It makes no sense. Nothing gets resolved. Almost nothing is different from the beginning of the series from the end.
The score is 6/10 exclusively because Episodes 8-11 are excellent. Episodes 1-7 and 12 are a boring slog that focuses too much of their time in bakeries and not enough time addressing any of the actual issues Jean is meant to be investigating. If I were to give a score based on those episodes alone, I would give this section a 1/10.
SOUND: 7/10:
ACCA's soundtrack isn't bad. You get some funky beats here and there, which can be fun if you're listening for them; otherwise, the music seems to fade too far into the background to notice. The OP track is a blast, and the ED is very pretty. The voice acting in the series is good, but nothing particularly notable.
ART: 8/10
The only reason that I didn't score the art for ACCA a perfect 10 is because there are some clear corners that were cut in order to afford to make it as beautiful as it is. The show is almost like a painting come to life. The colours and linework are brilliant, and the lighting is always perfect. There are so many gorgeous shots littered throughout this anime, it's a wonder anyone manages to talk about anything else when it comes to this show. Annoyingly, most of the budget shows in the final episode, where every other shot shows characters without faces, even in close-up shots.
It pains me to score such a beautiful anime so low, but aesthetic is all ACCA brings to the table.",Negatif
"ACCA: 13-ku Kansatsu-ka or ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept. was similar to a single dry, crusty saltine. It's boring and forgettable with only a little bit of substance to abate your hunger.
• While, superficially, a stylized tango with political intrigue, ACCA falls short of any kind of tension or excitement that could be gainedーcontinuously killing moments with non-stop talk of food and delicatessens.
• Initially, I had a lot of hope for ACCA. I like series that are political and I was drawn to the art style. I had only been aquatinted briefly with Natsume Ono's work before. I watched all of the anime for Ristorante
Paradiso, which was average but watchable, and the House of Leaves manga, which I had read four or five volumes of it AGES ago, I had no memory of what even happened in it except for vague details, if that tells you anything.
• Despite not being a huge fan of her other works, I'm not one to completely blacklist a creator due to that fact. Well, not if you're Masakazu Yamaguchi's Arm of Kannon, localized as Birth, it’s a different story. That's one of the worst things I've ever read in my entire life!
• Seriously, fuck you, Tokyopop! Ahem, back to ACCA, the pacing is REALLY bad. Madhouse has been going downhill for a few years now, being steadily replaced by the superior Studio MAPPA; and this series has made me painfully aware that there probably isn't going to be another Kaiji, unless it’s a sequel.
• The character development is non-existent. It's pretty much occupied with a bunch of shallow, food-obsessed talking heads. Between the eating of bread and constant yammering, it implied that there may be a build-up, tension, or even what most stories need to function: a climax.
• The ending is slightly refreshing and wraps up the points, but watching this is like watching a guy with a monotone voice give a lecture geography with small tidbits about the actual subject and the rest about how good a baguette would taste with melted butter. And for emphasis on how annoying the foodie crap was, I didn't want to eat bread while watching this show because it's constantly like, pan this, pan that, pan in my open butthole.
• My Japanese learning app even treats me with more respect on the subject of bread. The jazzy lounge music while characters babble to each other while doing mundane things is not my ideal show. I don't understand why there is such a following to this cardboard cut-out, let's-paste-a-story-together model. There is nothing inspiring or ambitious about this series; just a plain, null narrative.
• Listening or watching things about current affairs and politics is far more enjoyable than watching this series that is pretty much just a splash of colors with some pseudo-deep “intellectual” social commentary. I would not recommend ACCA to ANYONE, unless they enjoy pretentious blathering and random food porn that contributes nothing to the plot. I give ACCA a 2/10.",Negatif
"As much as I love anime for what it is, the shows that stick with me usually break the mold in some way.  ACCA 13 is all that and a bag of chips- let's break it down:
Story:
This is basically the closest anime comes to John Le Carre-esque spy fiction despite not being an out and out spy show.  At every turn, we are asked to guess at the motivations of a broad cast of characters.  Miraculously, the show builds a dense and reasonable network of motivations in the span of 12 episodes.  Reveals are doled at a pretty consistent pace instead
of being bunched up at the end, but my interest was consistent.  Not only that, there are some really surprising twists and turns- just really well thought-out.
Art:  I'm can't speak on technical terms here, but I did find the show really attractive, crisp, and well-animated.  The style, much like everything else in the show, is not the anime typical, with a stylized but mature feel.  Character designs were distinctive and well-adapted to the characters themselves without relying overmuch on tropes.  There's not much call for action, but the animation serves the story's needs exceptionally.  The OP and ED are also really well done- I watched them most eps instead of skipping.
Sound:  If the story is John Le Carre, the music accompanying it is closer to '60's style Ian Fleming (James Bond).  The mood alternates between the intrigue at the heart of the story and lighter cues for more character development.  It's not quite an OST I'm rushing out to listen to outside the context of the show, but it feels natural and inseparable in retrospect.  And again, the OP and ED are top shelf.
Character:  It doesn't make sense that a show with this many characters packed into 12 episodes can accomplish so much on the character front.  Just about the entire cast is likable, and the story maximizes efficiency with a couple of subplots/motifs to create sympathy with some of the more important minor characters.  And the fact that viewers care about the characters makes a few of the later twists really pop.
Who is this show for?  I've seen others call the show a slow burn.  It's hard for me to see that.  I've seen plenty of slice of life shows that, yes, I struggle through over a longer period of time (even if I think they're quite good- like 3 gatsu no lion).  But 13 ACCA doesn't really let go of the main plot and keeps you constantly guessing as to A) what's going on and B) how the characters will resolve the conflict once they figure things out.  So I think if you're the type of person who like spy/mystery/heist type movies and books that play cat-and-mouse with your head, you're going to love this.
This one will stick with me and has no business being rated as low as it is here on MAL.",Negatif
"Hello. My name is Joyce.
ACCA13, while claiming it as a masterpiece is far-fetched, is a story without unnecessary flash and barely any annoying, anime-common hamfisting and repetition.
Again, not a masterpiece. But god, this is a show anime needs really, really badly.
It respects its audience enough to put 2 and 2 together - and though not all too difficult to piece together, it is a story with a lot of nuance, and one I am eager to see progress.
Please watch this. The first episode is long-ish and boring, but if you don't have ADHD, I'm certain you'll enjoy it.
The art is amazing, the occasional symbolism
makes you go ""ooooh"" not ""I get it already"", the color palettes make me swoon, the food looks great - the only ""issue"" with the art is that their noses are uber-pointy. Make of that what you will.",Negatif
"Decently build Fantasy world with political powerplay for the throne.
Story (8)
While the story moves very slowly, with slightly too much slice of live in the first third of the show, but still engaging. There isn't much action; if you are looking for gunfights, chase scenes or even stealthy action, this will dissapoint. It' dialolge driven. The- to me- best parts are the presentations of the different states, they not only help to expand the world and scale of the story, but also further and intensify the plot. The Royal Backstory we get was also quite enjoyable, interesting mostly due to the perspective it was told
from, but a bit predictable. that sadly goes for the rest of the show too. Interesting, but kind of predictable. If you're familiar with the genre, non of it is really surprising. Still well executed tho.
Now, one big concern i still have, is weather this anime will go full facist or not. There have been very few indicators until now, exept for-you know- the ACTUAL SS UNIFORMS and the blond blue-eyed protagonist, + the choice of what appears to be the main villain. I really hope it wont go there, but with our MC having literally no opinion on anything, it's a bit hard to tell how well the show will fair in this regard.
Art (7)
Intersting style , with a good colour pallete, which both helps to connect the fantasy elemts to the modern ones. Funny enaugh, kind of similiar to Ouran high school host clubs style. Thou not in a bad way. The faces also don't look the same on every character, even the girls. That's nice. Not so nice is how stiff the movements seem. I suspect that they have a pretty tight budget; non detailed animation looks pretty bad, and they move very stiffly, if they move at all. They try to keep them as still aas possible. There are however no huge noticable quality drops. The style is still very refreching, managing to be dark and serious despite it's warm , nearly neon colours.
Sound (6)
The voice actors all do a pretty decent job, but the dialoge is often pretty slow with wierd pauses. Some Seem to also not fully mash with the characterdesign/ expression shown on screen. May seem like a nitpick, but i really couldn't get used to it , and i binged the 10 episodes currently out.
Character (4)
This shiw has many, though they are easy to categorize. Smart and serious persuing their goals (now in the flavours good and evil),  dumb and/or naive while friendly and/or harmless (tend to be annoying, but generally ok) and quiet but competend.
The MC is one off the last group, though he is sadly the worst among them; he is just quiet and competend. No emotions whatsoever. Lukewarm on everything. Never angry or happy. Looks and acts as if he was about to fall asleep any second. I guess he's supposed to be cool. To me he only seems bored. It gets better as the show progresses, but it's still really off putting, and makes it difficult to get into the story. How is one supposed to connect to character, if they don't have any emotions.
Also many of the charcters are sterotypical for their role in the story, which in turn makes the story predictable. If they would have given some of them a better introduction or more actual character, it would have been more suspensefull.
Plus the german ""names"" are all exeptionally dumb. Nouns aren't names. But that's more of a nitpick.
Enjoyment (5)
Nice to look at, but the slow dialoge and sometimes obvious plot twists, combined with disconnect from the MC make it quit hard to chew.
Overall (6)
Slow with mediocre to boring charcters, but pretty neyt political worldbuilding. If that sounds good to you, it's worth a look. Still quite likely to turn into a   facist propaganda thing sooooo.......yeah. have fun.",Negatif
"This anime starts off fantastic, but I found the plot going in an uninteresting direction as it went on.  The animation style is unique and a bit jarring at first, but you get used to it, and the style seems to fit well with the low key tones of the story and characters.
There are some fantastic characters in this and it is a shame that they aren't explored properly.  The last few episodes feel rushed and the ending fairly unsatisfying to me.  The show has a different feel than most anime and I really wish that it had stuck with the tone
of the early episodes and kept the plot on the same simmer it had been going on.
This is definitely worth a watch, but be prepared to get disappointed.",Negatif
"ACCA 13... definitely a sleeper in a season that I personally felt disappointed by. There were hardly any anime that drew my attention at the time, but ACCA 13 drew me back every week.
Like many have said before me, this anime is EXTREMELY plot driven. The story is quite heavy and immersive. The audience is thrust head first into this fictional world such a warm and approachable manner that it's hard to complain over the pace of the anime as the story progresses through the 12 episodes.
At it's core, I think the anime is looking for the audience to reflect on themselves. The
fact that there are 13 different districts that work in different ways, the idea of a royal family that exists as an entity outside of the established system, the plot by one family to attempt to overthrow the established system, it's all heavy stuff and calls into question what we think is the right way to live in our world.
There were quite a number of characters introduced to us over the season, however, we do get all the information we need from the main characters. We get to see the growth and backstory for a lot of the characters. The show makers really did find ways to weave in the backstory into the overall narrative in such a way that the characters are so connected to their place of origin that make them feel all the more real.
At it's best, ACCA 13 provides a fantasized version of our world and really helps us reflect on what it means to be from a certain place, what it means to live with your neighbors, and what it means to grow within a place.
The art and music for the series was great all the way through. It felt very nostalgic and took me back to a different era of anime. The whole package felt very clever and I have to say that I felt so much smarter after each episode. The show plays out in such a way that you feel immersed and are also a part of the larger narrative.
It was a great watch and I really do wish more people catch onto it. It's an enjoyable show to watch and one that is easy to watch as well. It's light enough for those that only so often watch anime and true enough to the form to satisfy even the most veteran of anime watchers.",Negatif
"This show is painfully slow, the outcomes of the waiting doesn't look rewarding enough, the characters are either uniteresting or annoying, the art style and the music are really good and out of the box, but when I revisit it I think: ""why on this show? Such a waste of potential"". I didn't get if every major character that the main character interact (like politicians, royalty and possible civil conspiracists) should sound misteryous and suspect, but without giving many informations until the episode that I saw everybody looks bland and I really don't care about this Coup d'etat until then.

"Acca-13 is fairly slow anime and for most of it there's a sense of confusion as you're not sure exactly where the story is going. When you do eventually find out, it feels a bit out of nowhere but hits hard regardless. Afterwards, when you discover what's going on, it has a bit of a problem ending in a real satisfying way or keeping momentum, often using the exceptional art and music as  a crutch. But Acca-13 still succeeds in creating a unique experience that I haven't seen replicated in any other anime which at the very least takes it away from mediocrity. If
the pacing was a bit better, I feel this could've been a solid 8 or 9 but as it is now, there are too many pauses and side stories that feel unimportant and just drag out the story.",Negatif
"Nowadays most popular anime series are those with big fight scenes involving overpowered mc.
Hence, it’s nice to come across an anime series whereby the premise is mainly on dialogues. ACCA is a seinen anime series that will appeal to a more mature audience as it deals with political science, witty humour and to a certain extend office politics.
I will not give away any spoilers in this review but instead touch on my personal view of how I felt the recognition that this anime deserves.
If you are even reading this review, it would mean this anime has piped your interest. My advice is to watch the
first two episodes and if it interests you than watch the whole series. If you find it boring than skip it as the rest of the anime will have the same tone.
I will expect that this anime will only appeal to a certain niche in the anime community as no offence but I doubt a young audience will appreciate this series.
No epic fights, no battles, no transporting to another world, no slice of life and no romance comedy.
Just a lot of smoking and political wheeling and dealing.",Negatif
"When Acca came out it caused three types of reactions:
-Those who lost their shit because it was made by the same author that wrote House of Five Leaves.
-Those that lost their shit because it seemed similar to Joker Game.
-Those that didn’t watch any of those shows and thus didn’t care about it at all.
And I am one of those that didn’t watch it when it came out. So, I decided to check it out now and found it astronomically boring.
So, there’s a kingdom composed of thirteen states and a public service organization that maintains peace amongst all of them. Jean, the protagonist,
is an inspector of said organization and is doing inspections in every state while rumors of a coup d'état have spreaded throughout the kingdom.
Starting with the strongest aspect of the show, the sound department; the sound effects are passable but the soundtrack is very good, sometimes calm, sometimes upbeat, but always classy. I’m not much of a fan of its opening and ending, but both were good, the former got a song with an original and interesting mix of different music genres and also great visuals, while the latter was simply beautiful. There is a second ending that was ok too. As for the voice acting, I think some of the choices in the casting weren’t accurate (Pastice), but everyone did a good job.
Following with the visual department, it looks weird mostly due to the color palette, it has some quality drops and since it’s not a series where the movement is important, that element is rather weak. Other than that, is a solid work mostly for the backgrounds and the character designs, which although having a generic look of a josei manga, they still manage to look different than most other series, again, mostly for the color palette. Although they have weird hair colors, most of the characters look as serious adults, with the obvious exception being the fat version of Tintin, seriously what’s up with that guy? Also, since every district that is part of the kingdom is evidently based on a real country, there’s a lot of variety amongst them in shapes, traits, skin, clothes and stuff. It fits the setting nicely, which, as I said, it is based on real countries from Europe, Asia and to a lesser extent, Africa; so there’s also a lot of variety in the series when it comes to backgrounds, and everything looks beautifully drawn.
Speaking about the setting, this is when the negatives start since it doesn’t make much sense, although the depiction of the countries the states were based on were mostly accurate, the whole setting looks like it’s based on the post-war era and yet there are satellite antennas and even modern day technologies such as cell phones and notebooks.
The plot feels slow, mostly due to the tone of the first episodes; where the protagonist, Jean, go to every state, sees the situation on everyone of them, takes little action on some small conflicts that happens there with a totally disinterested attitude, eats sweets and breads, buy some more sweets and breads for his sister (mostly sweets) and drinks lots of beer with his best friend; but midway on the series the story tries to convince the viewer that he was actually plotting the coup d'état all along. HOW? He was clueless about it until the Director of the organization told him. Also these first episodes have some silly moments like every scene with Lotta, the mc’s sister; and the prince, because, well, he is stupid, no, seriously, even the other characters point it out until the final episode.
Things get more interesting and serious on the middle episodes and onwards, there were still some comical moments, but from that point the series feels more focused on its plot and drama. The coup d’état was moving forward, slowly and completely by talking about it, but moving forward regardless; and there were some really touching moments regarding Jean and Jino’s past, where the show starts to  present its characters as people instead of spies puppets. But when the series was going well, the finale came and it was a complete ass-pull. Turns out Jean had a master plan within his master plan all along; and what a plausible one, stop everything with two people, yeah, right; also, there was no foreshadowing about it, it was complete bullshit.
Jean is easily the most boring and uninteresting character in the whole show, although he has a great past, he doesn’t react to anything that is going on in an interesting way, not even the revelation of his real identity; I’m not saying that the series should have showed that in an overdramatic way but we got…almost nothing. Also he is labeled as some super genius by everyone else when he is otherwise clueless, disinterested and distant on the first episodes; but I will admit that he got slightly better on the middle when he starts having internal thoughts about how to proceed on the whole thing…until his stupid hidden master plan within a master plan ruined everything. Well, at least he is slightly better than most of the teenagers with first world problems modern anime is so full of; and most of Urobuchi’s passive mouthpieces. There was only a moment when Jean seemed a human, and that was only because he got turned on by Mauve.
Speaking about her, why wasn’t she the main character? Apart from being the definitive waifu from 2017 (with Angie Varley from Mahoutsukai no Yome being a close second), she is also constantly thinking and investigating about what’s going on, while also having strong ideals, she is the whole opposite of Jean, give her a past and make her the main protagonist, and this show is automatically better.
Jino was another decent character, although he is shown as only a typical cool mysterious protagonist’s best friend in the beginning, the revelation of his past, and his work as a double agent, as well as his actual thoughts and feelings about the whole situation, and being shown as someone with actual own will, made him a lot better.
That’s as far as the good goes with the characters; the others aren’t bad, but nothing more than passable, the antagonists are not psychotics PURE EVIL ones like lots of anime today like to portray theirs, but nonetheless; they still remained as typical mysterious master minds behind the whole thing with little to none information about them, and the secondary characters didn’t really matter, Lotta and the female subordinates of Jean were particularly annoying, what does sweets, breads, and girls talks have to do with a military setting where a coup d’état is taking place? They are useless and unnecessary but on the other hand at least they felt like people. Wobular could have been a good character if he had more presence, something that didn’t happen, but he was still ok; the exact same thing can be said about Oulu.
In the end, Acca wasn’t a bad series; it does have problems regarding its pacing, setting and closure, but the plot wasn’t awful thanks to its mid episodes, the cast was decent because it didn’t have teenagers with first world problems, moeblobs or psychotics villains, the production was good and the setting was realistic up to some point, and it didn’t ruined said realistic setting completely with a psychotic edgelord loli that blows up shit with magic like Youjo Senki did.",Negatif
"TL;DR – A not entirely un-enjoyable series, though one where much of what's funny seems unintentional, or at least it's hard to tell when other anime take the same things so seriously. How this one seems to be taken so seriously by some people, though, I cannot fathom.
On an island that looks like Japan if re-imagined by a second rate marketing agency, the peaceful kingdom of Dowa unknowingly stands on the brink of chaos. A royal succession crisis - with the only legitimate male heir to the aging emperor being a vein, prideful wastrel – is being exacerbated by persistent rumours that the kingdom's member
states are plotting a coup. All that seems to stand in between peace & war is Jean Otus, deputy chief investigator of ACCA; the military/bureaucratic organisation that is responsible for running the kingdom.
Sporting a uniform straight out of a 1940s Hugo Boss catalogue, Otus' seemingly routine task of auditing the thirteen regional ACCA branches soon sees him caught up in a conspiracy that leads right to the top & involving him in ways he couldn't imagine. Everything looks set for ACCA to be a riveting conspiracy thriller, even with the slow, methodical pacing it begins with.
So why can it seem so boring?
If production issues were the only problem, it wouldn't matter so much. While no car crash, ACCA is one of the lowest effort Madhouse productions I've seen in some time. Not unpleasant to watch, none the less everything looks & moves stiffly & awkwardly, while backgrounds are static at best & at times are so basic they could almost pass as a Rothko painting. It gets worse as the series progresses, to the point where they simply stop giving unimportant or middle-distance characters eyes in a number of cuts.
Meanwhile the OST, while one wouldn't call any of it as bad, can often charitably be described as elevator music, particularly at more light hearted moments. In short, it's a fairly low effort production that appears to add nothing to the source material beyond colour. This isn't such a big issue, given the slow pace & dialogue driven nature of the ACCA. But it does mean that if the story fails to hold you, the production won't either.
Which wouldn't be as much of an issue if the story or characters could carry themselves. Jean is admittedly a pretty decent protagonist, at least at first when he's more of a means to take the audience to different locations rather than the focus of events. However, he's a pretty cliché-cool character, not one to mince words & smoking like a chimney – an image so old hat that Cowboy Bebop made a running joke out of it twenty years ago.
The rest of the cast, however, rarely contribute much beyond their increasingly limited roles in the shows ever expanding ensemble. Jean's friend Nino for instance, despite his cool hacker dude look, is pretty much just there so once an episode he can appear to say “I'm totally not following you” & then later “someone else is totally following you.” His sister Lotta is, despite the mangaka being a woman, best summed up as a middle aged man's image of an ideal young woman – pretty, polite, loves anything sweet & is so naïve that when assassins are trying to break in, her biggest concern is that they might damage the windows. I'd like to think it's meant as a joke, but you can never tell with anime.
The conspiracy that drives ACCA's plot could have been the shows saving grace, if they hadn't introduced it in the first episode. While not the focus of the first half, the writers none the less felt the need to spend a portion of each episode on the machinations going on behind the scenes, which becomes increasingly confused & convoluted as new twists & turns keep being added. It's only not more of an issue because the ending renders much of it irrelevant.
ACCA's world also starts losing its appeal pretty quickly. While more varied & globally minded than is typical for today's anime, it also quickly takes the form of a rather strangely laid out version of It's a Small World that doesn't really work as an actual nation. I'm not sure which “district” was my favourite, the Les Miserables world or the Viva Las Vegas one. It ultimately comes across as though the creators like the idea of an outside world, but have never visited it.
There's also clearly an attempt at social commentary going on, with a lot of attention being drawn to social & regional disparities. However, it goes about it in some odd ways; for instance with Jean's chain-smoking being made out to be a bourgeoisie luxury until he says “nuh-uh I'm actually totes poor” & everyone just goes with it. It seems doubly odd, given who it turns out Jean is, but it's there now so people can say “omg this show has so much to say about the world.” Or maybe it's also meant to be funny.
More negative - & this paragraph spoils parts of the ending so be warned – is that, while ACCA contains some of the whitest Native-Americans outside of a John Ford film, the Kingdom of Dowa has every shade of hair & eye colour represented, but next to no people of colour. Indeed, when it becomes clear (as if it wasn't obvious from the start) what role in the conspiracy the sole brown skinned people play, it starts to feel a tad racist. This isn't helped by how Jean is a jackbooted Aryan & the conspiracy is 'successfully' halted by ACCA becoming a de-facto military dictatorship (a Shogunate, if you will) while the brown people – scheming Arabs who control the oil supply, naturally – are kicked out the kingdom. The new dictator is a woman, though, so at least you could call it a progressive dictatorship.
A lot of this could be laughed off as a joke if it didn't fit in with an oddly right-wing, revisionist trend seen in recent anime like Kancolle, GATE & Joker Game. Speaking of JG, it's hard not to see that show's outsized success & loyal fanbase as at least somewhat responsible for ACCA being in the state that it is. A sloppy series that really could have used more production time & resources, it's easy to think that the production committee, dominated by merchandising companies, were pushing to get it released in time to cash in, apparently with some success.
I guess ladies love jackbooted gentlemen.",Negatif
"(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)
ACCA: 13-ku Kansatsu-ka features lots of smoking. Thankfully for me, I’ve never smoked a day in my life.
The horrible side effects. The frightening commercials. The wisdom from my parents. Many an influence has made the decision to avoid cigarettes an easy one, indeed. It’s not an incredible feat by any standard, but I’m glad that I did not start something that would only negatively impact my health.
While ACCA itself does not (and literally cannot) smoke, its mistakes hurt it enough that it doesn’t need to inhale nasty chemicals to reach the same unhealthy state.
STORY
ACCA centers
on an unassuming man by the name of Jean Otus. As Deputy Chief of the Territory Inspection Department within ACCA, the esteemed organization that protects the people through governmental rule, Jean finds himself tasked with visiting each of the nation’s thirteen districts. But, little does he know, a coup d’état broils – and he’s at the center of it all.
From the very beginning, the anime sets itself up as a mystery drama with all the makings of an intriguing tale at its disposal. The encroaching coup foreshadows the endgame. Jean’s semi-unreliable-narrator status forces the audience to keep everyone under scrutiny. A handful of different perspectives, from the royalty of Dowa to the Five Chief Generals of ACCA itself, keep the puzzle pieces in reach but slightly out of position.
It’s all there – but ACCA cannot complete the picture.
One of ACCA’s bigger blunders comes from an inability to land firmly on its more dramatic reveals. Despite the show’s penchant for mystery, when it comes time to unveil certain information, the landing doesn’t stick either because the show fails at qualifying this info or because it isn’t as weighty as the anime would have the audience believe.
For example, Nino reveals himself to Jean once Jean knows that Nino has been spying on him. Yet the subsequent “showdown” occurs in the middle of a forest without much consequence, leaving the dynamic between them unaltered.
Jean learning of his royalty status also makes for weak drama. He and Mauve cross paths on a sidewalk in Dowa where she drops the info bomb on him. The two talk a little more about his actions and his suspected involvement, but this revelation does not lead to anything more plot-wise.
The gifted cigarettes are even more anticlimactic. Upon visiting a new district, Jean receives an oddly designed cigarette that will presumably hold major significance or be used for something grander later. Nope. Instead, they simply represent each districts commitment to the coup. Something that Jean already knows and hears regularly when he talks with the nation’s different peoples directly.
To the anime’s credit, it does itself a service in providing a full backstory into the origins of this tale and how Jean’s situation came about. Episode eight goes back in time, taking on different perspectives and highlighting the series of events that eventually led Jean (and Nino and Lotta) towards their strange lifestyles. This dramatic reveal, unlike almost all others in the show, gives an appropriate amount of time, an appropriate amount of detail, and an appropriate amount of importance.
Besides the dramatic reveals, there’s also trouble with the districts themselves. As the title of the show describes, thirteen distinct districts split up the entire nation. A territory where, like Texas, everything is bigger. A city gung-ho about gambling. A tropical place where the inhabitants live uncharacteristically long lives. As Jean travels abroad, the audience comes to see that each district truly does have its own personality.
However, this separation also leads to a disconnect. These districts neither affect one another nor ACCA, failing to introduce anything wholly relevant to the plot save for representing another area that Jean visits. Plus, as the season progresses, the anime must make way for the reveals and the backstory and the ensuing finale, leaving even fewer chances for ACCA and the districts to make a name for themselves.
And that’s a problem. Thematically, the anime argues for two key points: the necessity of order and the existence of individualism. The former comes through in ACCA’s ideals, the continued peace of the nation, and the looming threat of a coup that drives the story. The latter comes through in those districts and the uniqueness with which they handle and portray themselves.
These two points are linked. Order gives the districts the freedom to express themselves, and individualism gives way to a nation that respects ACCA’s guidance. Throughout the season, the anime likewise makes this connection between the two. Each district has their own strengths, their own wishes, and their own presentation that shape their identity, and ACCA’s representatives watch over their territories, taking in their culture while managing their direction.
Yet ACCA almost never challenges this symbiotic relationship between order and individualism. Instead, it keeps the disconnect going – to the point that it’s way too late. The threatening coup that the anime has been building towards the whole season doesn’t actually happen, and, when the districts finally do come together, there’s no meaningful exchange. They don’t share interesting words or create thoughtful ideas. It all amounts to an unfulfilling ending that makes the audience wonder what was so important about this story to begin with.
Episode four, where Jean travels to Suitsu district, marks one of the only times such a challenge occurs. Stuck in 1700’s America, their coup (lots of coups in this show) demonstrates what happens when too much order takes hold, inviting Nino’s involvement, Jean’s promise to hide what went on, and the show’s arguably only memorable sequence.
Despite so much misplaced importance, the anime does try out other narrative routes. An assassination subplot targets both Lotta and Jean, but Lotta’s lacks reasoning and Jean’s isn’t too effective since Nino (willingly) stepped out of the picture for a while.
There’s also the real coup forming under Lilium’s leadership, but it’s not handled well. It’s introduced too late, and it’s rather convenient that Pranetta district strikes fortune to keep the nation afloat (since Lilium’s district’s defection means no more resources for anyone). And why would Jean even be manipulated by them in the first place? He never showed signs of that throughout the season, and his calm approach to life wouldn’t make him an easy target whatsoever.
The anime does reveal that Owl, Jean’s supervisor, was the guard that watched over Schnee, served as Nino’s secret boss, and destroyed Jean’s letters for reassignment. And there’s symbolism attached to the red bird: freedom, optimism, peace. But these small details are not nearly enough to make up for the anime’s numerous narrative problems.
ART/ANIMATION
Although ACCA’s narrative structure lacks cohesion, its artistic direction makes for an entirely different case.
It’s mainly seen in the characters’ designs. Their generally taller, lankier builds give them an air of maturity, and the decorated ACCA uniforms – all black with gold and red accessories – up their professionalism. They do at times go for the classic multicolor hair choices – dark-blue hair for Mauve (which is quite ironic), green hair for Payne, pink hair for Moz – that seem to go against the more realistic direction of the show itself. But this diversity matches that of the districts and their own diverse personalities.
These districts often have new scenery for the audience to admire. Idyllic plains with hills and grass. An underground civilization made of rock and stone. Red, mountainous regions. Snowy forests. Beautiful flower gardens amidst Egyptian-esque buildings. In essence, the very nature of ACCA’s plot provides many opportunities for the anime to showcase its diverse nation. Opportunities that it clearly takes full advantage of.
This scenery speaks nothing of the softer style portrayed or the more localized spots like the cozy bakery, the stalwart castle, and the headquarters of ACCA. It also doesn’t give insight into the anime’s actual animation which, sadly, does not maintain a similar quality as that of the background art. Mostly because there isn’t much movement going on at all.
Granted, ACCA can’t do much about the lack of movement when the show’s cool vibes demand a more subdued presentation. Moreover, the action therein doesn’t rise above the level of a chase-and-getaway sequence.
To make up for the subpar animation, then, the show incorporates a few directorial techniques to help improve engagement with the visuals. Certain shots provide interesting perspectives like when the camera takes on a fisheye lens atop the table where Jean and Mauve speak over dinner. And lighting as well as other small details, like creased clothing and a wide range of sky patterns, keep time and realism in mind.
At times, the show can falter slightly in its artistic integrity with the rare slipup of a character’s facial model. But the opening track’s and ending track’s respective visuals demonstrate that such slipups can be forgiven. For the OP, it involves a ton of different styles, colorings, and tricks that perfectly fit the super-cool vibe of both the show and the song. For the ED, the rough approach adds a floaty element to the dancing, and the choreography of the dance itself follows the emotional weight of the dancer’s pleas.
CHARACTERS
When it comes to ACCA and its cast, the anime unfortunately does not give them their due for one reason or another. To put it differently, the anime refuses to involve many of the characters or simply leaves them unexplored.
To start, and to be fair, many of the characters aren’t that essential to the plot. The different supervisors for the districts are simply there to show ACCA’s reach, and Qvalum, the king’s royal advisor, controls events in secrecy but doesn’t necessarily need anything else on him to play his part. Even Jean’s younger sister Lotta isn’t “required” to have more to her character since she is not a vital piece of the plot.
This argument begins to degrade once the scope tightens to those closer at the heart of ACCA. Rail, the side character who has a crush on Lotta, fails to find love, fails to protect Lotta, and fails to contribute anything besides furrowed gazes at Jean. There’s also three of the five main ACCA generals who may as well have never existed since two of them barely have more than ten lines total throughout the season and one of them had patriotism for his district about three different times.
Even if one excuses these characters for not being more involved in the story, two characters in particular are tougher to justify for their similar sidelined status: Mauve and Schwan.
Mauve stands as the idol of ACCA. A responsible leader and steadfast protector, she seeks to keep not only ACCA whole but also order maintained as much as possible. Thus, she investigates into the happenings of the potential coup – only for the higherups to stop her in her tracks.
So, she enlists the help of Jean to find out what he can since her hands are semi-tied. And that’s the end of her character. The first three episodes characterized her, provided her purpose, and established an interesting relationship with the main character. Afterwards, though, she does almost nothing at all besides give a standard speech about ACCA’s upcoming centennial event and talk briefly with Jean about his roots. I.e., despite being propped up as this major player in the game, the anime refuses to let her on the field.
Same thoughts go for Schwan. The king sired only daughters, so as the son of the king’s youngest child and the next in line to claim the throne, Schwan expects to take over the proceedings early on. When he does, he will make his first decree: the disbandment of ACCA (hence the people’s coup). But the king doesn’t relinquish his seat, infuriating the young prince.
Like Mauve, though, that’s the extent of his character. He has a liking for Lotta (who he doesn’t know is his cousin), and he passive-aggressively lets certain events unfold, like hanging his picture in front of the king’s favorite sitting spot and not stopping his aunt from attempting to assassinate both Jean and Lotta. Otherwise, he sits around eating bread, playing with his sword, and berating his subordinates without receiving any other important character developments.
Which makes his situation worse than Mauve’s because of how the story progresses. In the final episode of the season, ACCA enact their fake-coup plan to oust Lilium. Their “demonstration” and Mauve’s words convince the prince to keep ACCA around. That’s a nice gesture, but there’s no basis. No reason for him to suddenly flip his stance in the last several minutes of the anime. All because it never took the time to do more with his character throughout the season.
Speaking of Lilium, he gets (not that surprisingly) a similar treatment. However, he’s a bit more active. He approaches Jean a couple times, appears to butt heads with Grossular, and occasionally talks with some of the other side characters. Nothing extensive, but it’s there. His big development comes from the fact that he is the mastermind behind the upcoming coup. By getting Jean on the throne, he plans to manipulate the man and have his own district take over the nation.
It’s reiteration at this point, but his motivation isn’t impactful simply because this information comes about too late. Worse still, his tenuous relationship with Grossular isn’t that exciting or meaningful for the same reason. As for Grossular, more of the same words apply. He has one interesting aside with Jean in episode six within his own district where Jean remarks how he respects Grossular and does not believe he is a part of the coup. Otherwise, he sits at the Five Chief Officers’ table, taking on the role of pseudo-leader of ACCA and not much else.
Now, there’s a surprisingly easy explanation for why the anime skimps out on giving proper focus to Mauve, Schwan, Lilium, and Grossular. The explanation being that the story inherently forces almost all its attention on Jean and his travels. The focus follows Jean, so, because these characters almost never tag along with him, they lose out on appropriate developments.
Suppose, then, that these characters are, like the smaller side characters, also excused for their misplaced focus. This excuse-filled situation leaves the only two characters who remain consistently at the forefront of ACCA’s narrative: Jean and Nino. A question arises: Do the two best friends rise to the challenge of carrying this anime?
For Jean, the answer is a resounding “no.” Jean is a man known for two things: for wanting to leave his position as the head of the Territory Inspection Department and for smoking cigarettes (an upper-class item in their nation). As rumors swirl about a coup and his involvement with them, ACCA tasks the blonde-haired man with traveling to each of the thirteen districts to conduct his inspections per usual.
Characteristically, Jean is an emotionless man. Almost nothing fazes him; life and its weirdness create only calmness in his demeanor. He, alongside his sister, is also the proprietor of an apartment complex. Inherited after their parents sadly passed away during a horrific train accident. Mauve describes him as someone incapable of lying, and his fellow workmates respect his dutiful behavior.
In ACCA’s case, it’s debatable whether a stalwart character like Jean best fits the aims of the show. On the one hand, his reserved nature greatly helps in building the suspense and the mystery since he makes it hard for the audience to read what he’s thinking. Plus, he doesn’t let anything get to him, making him rather uninterested in coups and kings and courts.
On the other hand, his lack of a more interesting personality hurts his chances at becoming a more well-defined character. Furthermore, the biggest argument against Jean comes from what he did and didn’t do. He did visit all thirteen districts; he did not let his journey affect him.
He goes to all these places. Meets all these people. Discovers all that there is to this nation (something that his mother would have appreciated). Simultaneously, he learns of his heritage, almost loses his best friend, and even takes part in the fake coup.
ACCA sets him up as the perfect person to take over the throne since he, more than anybody, understands what this nation is about. But that doesn’t happen. Instead, come the anime’s end, he’s in exactly the same spot as he has always been. No different worldview. No different outlook. No different thoughts. He’s just unfazed, unchanging Jean from start to finish.
For Nino, the answer is a wishy-washy “maybe.” Nino (codename “Crow”) is Jean’s best friend, the two almost daily eating a meal and drinking alcohol at whatever restaurant suits their fancy. He’s close with Lotta, too, but as more of an uncle than a brother or romantic interest.
Unbeknownst to Jean (for a time anyway), Nino keeps track of the cigarette peddler from afar. Not as a stalker but instead as a spy, relaying information back to Grossular about what the potential coup sympathizer does during his inspections. Nino also confides in another, more mysterious figure. His behind-the-scene ploys and various actions are some of the biggest drivers behind the anime’s mystery, making him already a vital player in this tale.
Throughout the season, Nino sates Lotta’s worries about her big brother, protects Jean from wooden poles and metal bullets, and works his butt off in the shadows. Yet episode eight does the most work for his character. The twenty-minute-long flashback highlights how Nino went with his father to watch over Schnee (Jean’s mother) and her eventual family. Living a life of secrecy, becoming friends with Jean in high-school, and losing his father in the same train accident that also killed Jean’s parents.
Nino’s position and situation create a very interesting relationship between him and Jean. To Nino, Jean isn’t just his best friend. He’s also the only person he has left. Yet he could never be as close or as forthcoming as he probably would have liked. Always a camera-lens length away, he kept a thoughtful, watchful eye on the would-be prince while also sincerely looking out for him as best he could.
Come the end of the season, when Nino no longer must take pictures of the king’s extended family and can finally choose his own path, Nino rides away on a motorcycle. However, true to his character, he comes back, meeting with Jean not because he needs to but because he wants to. Sharing their relationship over food, alcohol, and a bit of reminiscing.
Does one okay-ish character make up for the main one remaining unaffected by the events he experienced and almost everyone else having little to zero impact? That’s a resounding “no,” too.
MUSIC/SOUND
Just as with ACCA’s artistic direction, much of the music within the anime oozes style and coolness that forms the mature vibe of the show itself.
Nowhere is this style more prevalent than in its opening track. Titled “Shadow and Truth,” a bit of reverb and a bunch of bongos get the song rolling. Sharp and wild saxophones with light piano work and a killer beat form a cool backdrop, and some English rapping brings the hip-hop funk. (“Silhouette, conspiracies, indefinite; never fool, gotta stay cool, smoke another cigarette.”)
Once the female vocalist steps in, the track officially flies high, her sensual singing and those of the other harmonizing singers smoothing out the piece that much more. It’s just too cool for school, standing proud as one of ACCA’s best traits.
The original soundtrack continues with the coolness through more jazz and rhythmic tunes. “Cigarette No. 13” uses lots of bass guitar and timed snaps for a weighty feel that knows it has nothing to fear. “In the Night Wave” goes with a cello and a slow, slow electric guitar that invites a moment’s rest. “Cold Talk,” arguably the best track offered, combines a slick riff, a steady drum beat, and the occasional piano strokes to create a piece that practically defines the word “smooth.”
Other tracks aim for more of the mystery. “Movin’ On” uses a faster pace and more grating effects. “Behind the Haze” uses a deliberate, singular piano note. “Breach of Faith” uses xylophones and ambient sounds. “Irregular Point” goes back and forth, both in playing and on the ears, with its music.
There’s even more variety available, and the examples above are only taken from the first disc of this two-disc, forty-five-track-full OST. Metaphorically speaking, the whole package deserves a district all its own.
Unfortunately, there aren’t any noteworthy voice-acting performances throughout the season. But the ending track does what it can to make up for this loss. Unexpectedly, though, the ED chooses something neither smooth nor cool but instead graceful. Light piano and soft singing dance across the ears, evoking a sense of beauty and longing in the listener.
The song goes for something completely different when compared to the music that precedes it. Arguably, it’s unfit given the anime’s style and the direction of the plot itself. Even so, the track proves that ACCA can do more than just cool and smooth.
ENJOYMENT
As I was watching this one, I had a couple of guesses for who the ultimate mastermind behind the coup would be. I attributed “rankings” to them based on their plausibility and intrigue.
The “way-too-obvious and really bad writing” choice was Grossular because that was too easy and too cliché.
Jean was the “you can’t trick me” choice since I knew the anime had the option to go with an unreliable narrator the whole way through.
Mauve was my “this is the correct answer” answer because she was in that innocuous position of coup preventer, and it seemed to me that she would make for the best twist.
And Lotta was the “almost no chance but just in case” guess since I wanted to cover the conspiracy-theory bases and make it known that the show did not “get” me in case they went for the super-ultimate plot twist. Also, it would have been crazy to see how they would handle it.
Lo and behold, Lilium was the culprit all along. I admit, and as is evidenced through my guesses above, that I was wrong, tricked. But I can’t say I was impressed.
That’s my whole stance with the show. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. To have the drama unfold and the mystery appease. Instead, nothing really took hold. Most districts were visited with little to zero fanfare. The same dialogue about coups and heritage were thrown about to ill effect. Its themes and writing didn’t get to those nuanced levels.
It also didn’t help that I didn’t like almost all the characters. Side characters like Maggie and Rail were meant to be there for semi-comedic relief, but I wasn’t laughing. The prince was annoying. Grossular and the other generals were never as intimidating as they needed to be. Lotta ate bread and sweets. Worst of all was Jean. Emotionless and plain, he turned out to be one of the more forgettable main characters I’ve seen in anime, doing almost nothing else besides smoking his cigarettes for twelve straight episodes.
Only two characters caught my attention: Mauve and Nino.
The anime’s decision to sideline Mauve for a large portion of the season was not welcome to me. While it seemed as though she would have a bigger role to play given her involvement in the earliest episodes, Jean not working with her and the show’s desire to focus on everyone but her let her potential go to waste. A shame, really.
As for Nino, he is to me the only worthwhile character from the entire show. Cool dude, unorthodox behavior, neat bit of backstory. If nothing else, he takes notable action throughout the season, making him better than almost everyone else by default. Which honestly says less about him and more about everyone else.
ACCA: 13-ku Kansatsu-ka inhales too much smoke. A neat artistic direction and a set of cool, smooth musical offerings create the show’s strong style. But its weak, unfulfilling story, its lackluster characters, and its boring developments leave it coughing and wheezing and far too unhealthy.
SUMMARY
Story: Terrible, a dramatic mystery tale that continually misaligns itself through anticlimactic reveals, lame subplots, and an inability to challenge its symbiotic theme on order and individualism
Art/Animation: Good, cool character designs, diverse background art, and a few directorial techniques do a lot to make up for the mediocre levels of actual animation
Characters: Terrible, Mauve, Schwan, and many of the other side characters don’t receive nearly as much attention as they should when considering their roles, Jean remains largely unaffected by his literal nationwide journey, and Nino’s intriguing relationship with Jean cannot carry everything by its lonesome
Music/Sound: Good, while none of the VA performances stick out, the ED dances gracefully, the OP oozes style, and the OST explodes with smoothness
Enjoyment: Terrible, lame choice for the mastermind behind the whole coup, Mauve was not around nearly enough, Nino’s the only one who seems to do anything tangible, and nearly everything else was boring
Final Score: 3/10",Negatif
"ACCA:13 is a slow-burn, cerebral, political anime which hones in on the thinking and strategies that surround government decisions. It ponders the notions of rebellion and seeks that type of plot out throughout the course of its narrative. But really that's all it attempts to achieve, political pondering and anti-climax.
Going in to this series I didn't expect a lot of action. I had heard about this anime a long time ago and when it popped up in my recommended anime catalogue I decided to give it a try. The outstanding art style was what initially drew me in, and then the anime's lively opening
begged me to stay. The show's ending is also beautiful, with an interesting sketchy art style to accompany its elegant yet rough animation. If you watch the ending all the way through it's a great way to spend the time wondering about the happenings of each episode. You will need to think about what happened if you're invested in the story, but maybe don't theorize too much as it, unfortunately, won't return the intrigue it sets up with satisfying results (or consequences for that matter).
The premise of the show is interesting in its own right, there isn't much political drama in anime as we know it right now (the best of its kind I've seen so far would be Legend of the Galactic Heroes; ACCA:13 does not pose as a direct rival to it, unfortunately). But when I say this show is slow-burn I mean it, whole heartedly. This show is about deliberation first and foremost and unfortunately in later episodes that deliberation comes without the serious stakes as it would in more traditional political dramas. You spend most of the time waiting for someone to make a move like an incredibly cautious board game.
ACCA:13's characters, for the most part, are laissez-faire. Direct actions rarely come, and if they do seem to come it is usually the result of a backseat puppeteer. If I were to name favourites, I'd say Nino is by far the best character. He is the most nuanced and his character decisions are the most motivated out of the entire cast. Mauve is also an incredible character. I only wish we got to see more of her own motivated action and expression of self that wasn't in need of Jean being there. To address Jean though, I think he would have been more compelling if only the story's plot wasn't stringing him along. That probably comes from his characterization though, he's laidback by proxy. Despite that I was in want of more drive from him as the narrative's central character. He was the key to everything going on and as a viewer I really rarely ever felt that way about him. His importance to the plot felt confused for most of the story until about two thirds into the series's course when it turned out nearly everything lied on his shoulders. He doesn't feel like the anime's main character.
Overall, don't expect your watch of ACCA:13 to be thrilling. It's a nice anime to lay back and watch for its sharp art style and delicious looking food stills (I was craving pastries and bread nearly every episode, that's how effective it is). But if you're looking for a political drama that delivers on intriguing set up and satisfying, fulfilling pay-off this anime may disappoint you as it surely disappointed me.",Negatif
"Welcome to the Vanilla cafe. Would you like to pre-order a vanilla pudding with vanilla toppings from our vanilla menu?
Ao Haru Ride is a shoujo romance slice of life manga adaptation of the same name. It follows a story of a curious high-schooler girl wishing to find out what happened to her crush from three years ago and why did he change. It has ""generic"" and Kimi ni Todoke written all over it just from looking at the cover, and going deeper, it further proves this statement.
Plot:
Futaba Yoshioka is your average 1st year in high school, who wishes to change herself and find new friends.
She stumbles across her middle school crush, Kou Tanaka, who has changed his name to Kou Mabuchi. Shocked to find his personality completely changed, she starts testing her feelings for him, all in attempt to find out what happened to his old self.
The premise screams vanilla and generic all over the place, and it is just as it looks. It is your average shoujo romance with a double unrelated love triangle introduced later on. There is just nothing driving the romance forward and it uses cheap gimmicks in an attempt to move it further but it is really an uninteresting story once you get familiar with the characters. The main love triangle feels very artificial and is only there to make some progress, and the secondary love triangle isn't explored at all. The plot devices the anime introduce to kickstart an event are quickly forgotten. And, in the end, nothing happens. It is extremely predictable from the very start and not engaging. However, for an anime that is entirely character-driven, plot shortcomings aren't as important as in other shows.
Characters:
The story follows a group of 5 teenagers. Starting from the worst, we have Murao, a silent and self-centered girl that later is not like that, for some reasons hardly mentioned. She is bland and uninteresting, but is a main piece of the second love triangle, as Kominato has a crush on her, and she has a crush on Kou's brother, Tanaka-sensei. Kominato himself is just a friendly and energetic guy, nothing else to say about him, he's not relevant at all. Yuuri is a shy but sweet girl who is a piece of the main love triangle, but it feels like she is just a plot device thrown in to escalate the plot. She has some sort of characterization and personality though, so she's not a bad character per se, but really underwhelming going against the main duo. Tanaka-sensei, Kou's brother, is an important character in Kou's personal drama and life and manages to have some good characterization in relatively short screen time.
And here we have our main duo, with the main protagonist Futaba going first. Futaba is a rather curious and gentle girl who has a crush on Kou but starts questioning her feelings after meeting him, after she got supposedly dumped by him several years ago, and circles around Kou to find out more about his changed personality. Futaba is not a great character by herself, as she is rather simple and two dimensional at most, but the best part about her is that she makes some great character interactions with Kou and the rest of the squad. There's nothing special about her, but she is the one that moves the story forward entirely by herself.
Kou is the best character in the series, surprisingly because he acts as a pseudo-plot device for Futaba. His personal drama and personality change is done very, very well and is the biggest highlight of the show. He has an ""I don't care"" mentality and acts like a typical jerk, but for some reason the group constantly tries to get along with him instead of leaving him alone. His story was predictable, but executed well after all, and is the only part of the show that didn't come off as bland and boring. (like the rest of the show)
For a character driven show, only two characters are relevant to the story at all. And that is really bad. At first you would have some sort of hope that you get to see a lot of interesting character interactions and different approaches to romance from different characters and how they react and develop from it but in reality, once you get familiar with the characters (around half of the show), all of them, except for Futaba and Kou (and plot device Yuuri) become completely irrelevant. And that is not how an anime should treat its cast. There was a limit to how much Kou and his story could have carried the rest of the show, and he alone couldn't quite reach the top.
Writing:
For the comedy, it is simple reactional stuff over and over again. Something happens, characters react and you are supposed to laugh. Basic, but it actually works better here than other shows since you have some sort of attachment to characters and most of the comedy comes from at times funny interactions between Futaba and Kou. There's no fanservice to keep you interested, and although it doesn't ruin the narrative by being there, which is a good thing, the show actually got boring mid-way through so I don't know, maybe they should have had that? There's not so much slice of life to talk about, but Futaba's wish to not be labeled as an outcast once she experiences that in middle school is done quite decently and worth mentioning (along with Yuuri's situation, although she is just ruined later on)
There aren't any obvious writing mistakes, apart from the extreme overuse of wind in dramatic  or tense situations, but I would like to mention that the show rather quickly and completely forgets a rather interesting plot device in ""making the main cast the class representatives"" which could have sparked some more interesting situations to happen. The anime didn't use the potential of some of the introduced elements and instead went along with the most generic and uninspiring way possible - a completely vanilla romance with no backdrops or anything else for you to care about. Didn't like the romance? Tough luck, there's nothing else for you here.
Animation and Sound:
There's nothing so much to talk about the animation, the art looks good but the chibi-looking face expressions were sometimes unnecessary and distracting, and made the show's comedy look like trying too hard.
The soundtrack is worth mentioning as having a few emotional pieces and rather well timed songs. It is easily the best technical aspect of the show, and you should look forward to the official soundtrack release. Another mention is Yuki Kaji in his role of Kou, which was executed outstandingly. I rather have him voicing these kind of characters rather than screamy kids (Eren, Satomi), cause here he can unfold his full potential.
Summary:
Ao Haru Ride is just an extremely cliched and generic title. The execution is decent, however it could have been better, but there are just no other hooks or interesting elements or setting to keep you interested, and it gets boring half-way through unless you absolutely love the characters. Not everyone's the same though. If you like Shoujo romances, then it's definitely a watch. It is not a bad show, but it is not a good one either. It is right down the middle, and that's why it deserves the rating it gets.
Final Verdict - 5.3/10",Negatif
"I have not read the source material for the show and the following review is for the anime adaption only, the manga, LN or other source material is not included in my review of this anime.
Ao Haru Ride is a character driven romance between the two main characters Kou and Futaba. The show kicks off when Futaba recognizes Kou at her high school and goes on from there.
Story
I pretty much already went over the basic premise but, it's also important to know that Kou and Futaba knew each other in middle school. The premise itself is kind of generic which isn't entirely bad. I liked
how the two main characters had met in the past and, now Kou was entirely different for reasons unknown to Futaba and the viewers. It was a good way to hook people.
Art
I enjoyed the art of the show. It was colorful and, the character designs fit the settings and, the characters themselves. The art is distinguishable from other series but isn't anything unique or all that interesting.
Sound
The show had a good OP and ED. The music during the show was appropriate and, sounded nice. Also, there was some good voice acting for the characters, especially Kou.
Characters
Sadly, most of the characters in Ao Haru Ride aren't all that great. The characters I didn't like were Yuuri, Kominato, Murao and Kou.
In the case of Kominato and Murao, they didn't add anything to the story. The show would have been the same if they weren't there. So why were they in the story, I don't know? In addition to not having a point, they aren't particularly interesting and, the viewer isn't really given a reason to care for them.
Yuuri is the second member of the Kou fan club and, the third member of the show's love triangle. The problem with her is that again, she doesn't do anything for the story, it would have been the same if she was removed from the show. All she does after befriending Futaba is obsess over a CD she borrowed from Kou. The fact that she and, Futaba both love Kou is supposed to be a source of conflict for herself and Futaba but, it doesn't really cause any issues in their relationship. Her love for Kou doesn't cause any conflict for the two main characters Kou and Futaba. Why I didn't include her with the other two pointless side characters is because Yuuri is supposed to have a purpose. She is supposed to be a part of the story. She is supposed to cause conflicts between the two main characters and, have conflicts with them but, she fails at all of the points I listed.
Kou starts off as an interesting character. The viewer is after all supposed to be drawn into the show by his mysterious change from being kind and, quiet to cold and, ""too cool to care"". My problem with Kou isn't that he can be an annoying, angsty teenager. My problem is that he isn't a consistent character. Somewhere around episode 7 or 8 all of his progression just disappears until the final episode. It feels really unnatural and, forced for the sake of the ""story"" which is finding out why Kou is different then he was before.
Ao Haru Ride forces this unnatural character reset by having Yuuri and, Futaba pursue Kou before they find anything out about him. If the writers would have put the revelations about Kou's past at the start of the show and, then had Futaba and Yuuri try to get with him everything would have made more sense and, Kou wouldn't have had to have a forced character reset.
Futaba, and Kou's brother are the only other relevant characters in the show. They are both members of the Kou fan club and, I didn't have any particular problems with either of them. That being said they aren't really all that great of characters either since the only thing about them that matters is how they feel about Kou.
Enjoyment
I enjoyed the beginning of the show. It may have been a generic premise but, it was well executed. I wanted to know more about the characters and, was interested to see how the show would progress. However, the addition of the side characters, love triangle and, after Kou's character reset, Ao Haru Ride just wasn't all that interesting or, something I really cared about anymore. One scene that left a terrible impression with me was when Kou told Futaba that he could sexually assault her if he wanted to after climbing on top of her. I just felt that it was unnecessary and, in bad taste.
Overall
I gave Ao Haru Ride a 4/10. It has good art and music but neither of these elements overcome the pit falls of the show. The biggest problem of the show is that it forces character ""resets"" for the sake of the story. Another problem is that the side characters don't do anything to warrant their inclusion in the show. For reference the most useful side character is Kou's brother whose only job is to feed Futaba information about Kou and, his back story. Finally, I really hated the creepy sexual assault scene.

"Beware: minor spoilers
I hate to go against the grain of other reviews here, but holy ever-loving HELL, this series irks me.

"“But I think it’s natural that not everything you try will go well, right? So, I’m gonna start again from scratch.”
-Yoshioka Futaba
Look at me, I’m stepping out on a limb again.  Ao Haru Ride is not a show I would typically watch, but I have slowly adapted my tastes to include the romantic genre of anime.  I will add though, Ao Haru Ride would not have been a good show even if romance was my favorite genre.  There are sparks of good writing and character development, but they get utterly squashed by the fact that nothing… happens in the entire anime.
There’s no bizarre twist, no seriously dynamic characters, not much of anything.  The anime is very plain and unfulfilling to watch.  But, nonetheless I’ll dive head-first into my review.
As previously stated, nothing groundbreaking seems to happen in Ao Haru Ride.  It’s a generic love story archetype with Yoshioka Futaba, a young high-schooler at its center.  She used to be in love with a boy name Kou in middle school, but Kou has changed quite significantly over the past couple of years.  This causes Futaba to mindlessly chase the image of the old Kou while desperately trying to understand the new one.  It does give a pretty good perspective of a teenage girl’s mind, as it often struck me as hilarious with some of the things she would get stressed about etc.  Ever since Futaba was seemingly rejected by Kou in middle school, she changed her appearance and personality to become less attractive.  Now reintroduced to her former lover, Futaba takes on the role of class representative in hopes to get Kou’s attention.  He and a few others follow suit, and there we have our cast of MC’s.  The rest of the characters are written in almost unnecessarily, as this anime almost entirely hinges on Kou and Futaba.
I feel the class representative element could’ve been uniquely incorporated in the show, but it served as nothing more than a small plot device to get the characters acquainted.  The rest of the love story pans out slowly, and uninterestingly.  The climax of the show involves both Futaba and Kou crying with each other, but doesn’t feature a single kiss.  Honestly, even the conclusion of the anime is open-ended.  Did they get together or not?  It’s like the writer of the series was like…. “Who cares if they got together?  It’s all about the ride!”  Except there was no ride at all, just mere attempts at a romance element.  There’s also two random love triangles thrown in the mix to make it worse.  The one with Yuuri, Kou and Futaba seems unrealistic.  I feel it’s not realistic for two high school aged girls to be in love with the same guy and have a friendly rivalry over it.  The writers missed an opportunity for some better writing here.  Also, the one with Murao, Kikuchi and Kou’s brother was entirely unnecessary and only detracted from the main story.  I’m not sure what I expected out of the show as a whole, but certainly it was more than what I got.
Yoshioka Futaba is a pretty vanilla MC.  Cute, misunderstood and desperately in love with a boy who appears not to give her the time of day.  She does go through some character growth throughout the series, but nothing groundbreaking.  Kou is a straight asshole, and undoubtedly hold the title for the best character in Ao Haru Ride.  The loss of his mother and distance from his brother and father made his drastic personality change justifiable, and his changes throughout the series are evident by his strange but understandable interactions with Futaba.  Yuuri annoyed the shit out of me, I can’t begin to explain my loathing for her character trope.  No one is that cutesy in the real world.  It just doesn’t work that way, so please stop writing in characters like this.  Pretty please?  Kikuchi existed only as a plot device for Murao, but seeing as to how she only spoke about ten lines in the entire show, he didn’t serve as much.  I liked Murao’s character type but her background or love affair with Tanaka was never explained and left me actually confused.  Tanaka actually seemed kind of creepy in dialogue he shared with Kikuchi with the end, basically saying “so what if I like her?”.  What a creepy dude.
The artwork is what originally drew me to this show, especially in the first episode.  It’s actually quite good.  I like the character models a lot; they look quite unique when compared to other shows out recently.  The environments are vivid and drawn exceptionally well, although some of the static scenes with dialogue felt a tad lacking.  And, I think Japan was a tad too windy that year…  I will say, I’m a sucker for the OP of Ao Haru Ride.  It’s actually really good.  Upbeat, cute and fun all describe it, and it made me look forward to the series even more.  Too bad it didn’t quite deliver.  The ED also did well for itself, emulating the overall feel at the end of each episode quite decently.  Voice acting was good, most notably for one of my favorite actors, Yuki Kaji.  He took a slight different approach than in Attack on Titan or Shinsekai Yori.  The rest of the soundtrack was also placed well in the show, and the more dramatic scenes were captured well due to the execution of sound effects.
I wanted to enjoy Ao Haru Ride, I really did.  The show just had so many things working against it.  A boring and overused story line mixed with mostly bland characters doesn’t give you the recipe for success.  I found myself getting bored at times, and that’s saying a lot with such a short anime.  It would only recommend this to fans of romance animes, and the OST is probably worth downloading as well.  Because of the bad taste in my mouth, it might be awhile until I watch another romance anime, but I understand there are far better shows in the genre.  Thanks again for reading!",Negatif
